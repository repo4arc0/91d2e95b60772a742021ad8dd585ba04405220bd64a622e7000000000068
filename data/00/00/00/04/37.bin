149
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,070
而产生的存在恐惧
of staring into the literal void of space,

150
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,270
我会说我今天感觉好一点了
I'd say I'm feeling a little better today.

151
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,080
感染已经结束了
Infection's run its course,

152
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,120
这要谢谢那位蓝恶魔
thanks to the Blue Meanie back there.

153
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,900
你一定会很喜欢她的
Oh, you'd love her.

154
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,780
非常务实
Very practical.

155
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,400
就是有点虐待倾向
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

156
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,340
燃料电池在打斗中被损坏
So, the fuel cells were cracked during battle...

157
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,430
我们找到了办法逆转离子电荷
and we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge...

158
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,960
争取到了大约48小时的飞行时间
and bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time.

159
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,550
但是现在已经彻底不能用了
But it's now dead in the water.

160
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,970
距最近的便利店有上千光年
Thousand light years from the nearest 7-Eleven.

161
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:45,720
明天早上氧气将会耗尽
Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning...

162
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,810
然后就完了
and that'll be it.

163
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,670
小派  我知道我说过再不制造意外了
Pep, I know I said no more surprises...

164
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,010
但我得说  我真的希望能完成这最后一个
but I gotta say I was really hoping to pull off one last one.

165
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,730
但是现在看来...
But it looks like...

166
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,070
你知道看起来如何
Well, you know what it looks like.

167
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,660
别为此而难过
Don't feel bad about this.

168
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,160
其实  如果你痛心难过个几周
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks...

169
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:12,960
然后带着巨大的罪恶感继续生活下去...
and then move on with enormous guilt...

170
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,690
也许我应该躺会儿
I should probably lie down for a minute.

171
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,960
让眼睛休息一下
Go rest my eyes.

172
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,800
请知道
Please know...

173
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,720
当我渐渐睡去  会和近来的每晚一样
when I drift off, it'll be like every night lately.

174
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,730
我很好  真的很好
I'm fine. Totally fine.

175
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,270
我会梦到你
I dream about you.

176
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,190
因为一直都是你
Because it's always you.

177
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,240
没能阻止他
Couldn't stop him.

178
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
我也一样
Neither could I.

179
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,190
等等
Hang on.

180
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,320
我没救下那孩子
I lost the kid.

181
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,490
托尼  我们都输了
Tony, we lost.

182
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,820
派珀她...
Is, uh...?

183
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,700
-太好了  -天呐
- Oh, good. - Oh, my God!

184
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,660
天呐
Oh, my God!

185
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:29,130
没事了
It's okay.

186
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,760
距灭霸来到地球  已经过了23天
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.

187
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,600
世界各国政府分崩离析
World governments are in pieces.

188
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,690
仍在运转的部门
The parts that are still working...

189
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:49,230
在进行人口普查  看来他是成功了
...are trying to take a census and it looks like he did...

190
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,790
他做到了他声称要做的事
He did exactly what he said he was gonna do.

191
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,700
灭霸消灭了...
Thanos wiped out...

192
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,580
一半的生命
...50% of all living creatures.

193
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:05,960
他现在在哪
Where is he now? Where?

194
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,920
我们不知道
We don't know.

195
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,550
他开了个传送门  穿过去了
He just opened a portal and walked through.

196
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,510
他是哪根筋不对
What's wrong with him?

197
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,590
他很愤怒
Oh, he's pissed.

198
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,970
他觉得自己失败了
He thinks he failed.

199
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:22,530
没错  他是失败了
Which, of course, he did...

200
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,870
但我们都失败了  不是吗
but you know, there's a lot of that going around, ain't there?

201
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,700
说真的  要不是你开口说话
Honestly, until this exact second

202
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,990
我还以为你是小熊玩偶
I thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,660
没准我就是
Maybe I am.

204
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,790
我们已经找了灭霸三周
We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now.

205
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:31,870
扫描外太空
Deep space scans...

206
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,070
卫星搜索  然而毫无发现
and satellites, and we got nothing.

207
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,320
托尼  你和他交手过
Tony, you fought him.

208
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,320
谁跟你说的
Who told you that?

209
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,550
我没跟他"交手"
I didn't fight him.

210
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,590
他用一颗星球暴揍了我
No, he wiped my face with a planet...

211
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,090
然后那个布里克街魔术师把宝石交出去了
while the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store.

212
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,320
实情就是这样  根本谈不上交手
That's what happened. There was no fight,

213
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,510
-好吧  -他根本不可战胜
- Ok.  - 'cause he's not beatable.

214
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,790
他有没有透露过任何线索或坐标
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?

215
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,980
我几年前就预料到了
I saw this coming a few years back.

216
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,880
我看到了幻象  我本来不想相信
I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

217
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,510
以为自己是做梦
Thought I was dreaming.

218
00:10:58,530 --> 00:10:59,610
托尼  我需要你集中精神
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.

219
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,470
我曾经也需要你
And I needed you.

220
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,950
我是指过去
As in, past tense.

221
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:06,350
那比你现在的需求重要  太迟了  哥们
That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy.

222
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,680
抱歉
Sorry.

223
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,350
知道我需要什么吗  我需要刮胡子
You know what I need? I need a shave.

224
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,000
而且我记得我告诉过你们所有人
And I believe I remember telling all youse...

225
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,540
托尼  托尼
Tony, Tony!

226
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,980
还在和不在的  我们需要的
...alive and otherwise, that what we needed

227
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,260
是一套保护世界的战衣
was a suit of armor around the world.

228
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:21,920
记得吗
Remember that?

229
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,930
不管那是否会影响到我们宝贵的自由
Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not.

230
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,260
那才是我们曾需要的
That's what we needed.

231
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,390
但那并没成功  不是吗
Well, that didn't work out, did it?

232
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,960
我说过我们会输的
I said we'd lose.

233
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,790
而你说  "那就一起输"
You said, "We'll do that together, too."

234
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,040
你猜怎么着  队长
And guess what, Cap?

235
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,590
我们输了
We lost.

236
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,500
而你不在场
And you weren't there.

237
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,650
不过我们就是干这个的  不是吗
But that's what we do, right?

238
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,900
总是在事后行动  我们是"复仇者"
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers."

239
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,820
"复仇者"  而不是"预防者"
We're the "Avengers," Not the "Pre-vengers."

240
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,700
-好了  -对吗
- Okay. - Right?

241
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,410
-你说得很明白了  先坐下吧  -好
- You made your point. Just sit down, okay? - Okay.

242
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,570
-不  我还没说完  -托尼
- No, no, here's my point. You know what? - Tony,

243
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,780
-对了  她可真棒  -你身体不好  坐下
- She's great by the way. - you're sick. Sit down.

244
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,580
我们需要你  你是新生力量
We need you. You're new blood.

245
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,660
一群身心疲惫的老家伙
Bunch of tired old mules.

246
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,960
我没什么可给你的  队长
I got nothing for you, Cap.

247
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,610
没坐标
I got no coordinates...

248
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,270
没线索  没战略  没选择
no clues, no strategies, no options.

249
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,860
屁都没有
Zero. Zip. Nada.

250
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,490
也没有信任  骗子
No trust, liar.

251
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,580
给你  拿着
Here, take this.

252
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,580
你找到他  戴上它
You find him, you put that on...

253
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,460
躲起来
you hide.

254
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,500
-托尼  -我没事
- Tony! - I'm fine.

255
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,960
让我...
Let me...

256
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,610
布鲁斯给他注射了镇静剂
Bruce gave him a sedative.

257
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,100
估计他今天之内都不会醒了
He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.

258
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,950
你们照顾好他
You guys take care of him...

259
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,020
我回来时给他捎点克佐利亚的神药
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back.

260
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,660
你要去哪
Where are you going?

261
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,270
去杀灭霸
To kill Thanos.

262
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,880
我们通常一起行动
You know, we usually work as a team here and, uh,

263
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,840
私下里说一句  现在士气有点低落
between you and I, morale's a little fragile.

264
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,920
我们知道太空是你的领域
We realize up there is more your territory,

265
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,490
但这也是我们的战斗
but this is our fight, too.

266
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,590
你知道他在哪吗
You even know where he is?

267
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,880
我认识可能知道的人
I know people who might.

268
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,000
不必麻烦了
Don't bother.

269
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,330
我可以告诉你灭霸在哪
I can tell you where Thanos is.

270
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,380
灭霸花了很长时间来完善我
Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me.

271
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,920
他改造我时  总爱说他的伟大计划
And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan.

272
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,050
就算被拆解了  我仍然想讨好他
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.

273
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,890
我会问
I'd ask...

274
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,020
等计划完成后  我们去哪
where would we go once his plan was complete?

275
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,600
他每次的回答都一样
And his answer was always the same.

276
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,230
"去花园"
"To the Garden."

277
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,420
真有爱  灭霸还有退休计划
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan.

278
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,570
那他在哪
So, where is he?

279
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,260
灭霸打响指时
When Thanos snapped his fingers...

280
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,670
地球成了宇宙级能量涌的
Earth became ground zero for a power surge

281
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,720
爆发点
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

282
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,660
可谓前无古人
No one's ever seen anything like it.

283
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,910
直到两天前...
Until two days ago...

284
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,630
这个星球上又发生了一次
on this planet.

285
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,960
灭霸在那儿
Thanos is there.

286
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,550
他又用了一次宝石
He used the stones again.

287
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:47,780
我们去的话  人手不足
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know?

288
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,240
宝石还在他手里  所以...
Look, he's still got the stones, so...

289
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,310
那我们就去夺回来
So, let's get 'em.

290
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:52,530
用宝石把大家救回来
Use them to bring everyone back.

291
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,620
就这样
Just like that?

292
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:55,530
对  就这样
Yeah. Just like that.

293
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,910
哪怕有一丝挽回一切的希望
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this...

294
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:01,500
我们也必须为不在这里的每个人一试
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.

295
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,210
就算我们去  我们怎么知道
If we do this, how do we know

296
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,750
结局会跟上次不一样
it's gonna end any differently than it did before?

297
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,660
因为上次你们没有我
Because before you didn't have me.

298
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,280
新来的妹子
Hey, new girl?

299
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,790
这里每个人都是干超级英雄的
Everybody in this room is about that superhero life.

300
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,010
要是你不介意我问问
And if you don't mind my asking,

301
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,390
这么久以来你都去哪了
where the hell have you been all this time?

302
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,710
宇宙里还有很多星球
There are a lot of other planets in the universe.

303
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,460
可惜那些地方没有你们
And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.

304
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,610
我喜欢她
I like this one.

305
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:49,240
我们去干掉那个王八蛋
Let's go get this son of a bitch.

306
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,390
好了
Okay.

307
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,270
这里谁没上过太空
Who here hasn't been to space?

308
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:17,530
怎么了
Why?

309
00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,480
你们最好别吐在我飞船里
You better not throw up on my ship.

310
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,350
接近跳跃点  三
Approaching jump in three...

311
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,270
二  一
two, one.

312
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,500
我下去侦查
I'll head down for recon.

313
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,430
这次会成功的  史蒂夫
This is gonna work, Steve.

314
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,810
我知道
I know it will.

315
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,190
因为如果不成功  我不知道该怎么办
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

316
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:10,420
没有卫星  没有战舰  没有军队
No satellites. No ships. No armies.

317
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,530
没有任何地面防御
No ground defenses of any kind.

318
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,280
只有他
It's just him.

319
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,790
那就够了
And that's enough.

320
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,630
不
Oh, no.

321
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,550
宝石在哪
Where are they?

322
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,100
回答问题
Answer the question.

323
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,560
宇宙需要修正
The universe required correction.

324
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,520
之后  宝石就没有用了
After that, the stones served no purpose...

325
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,330
只是诱惑
beyond temptation.

326
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,990
你杀了数万亿生灵
You murdered trillions!

327
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,110
你应该感激
You should be grateful.

328
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,740
宝石在哪
Where are the stones?

329
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,040
没了
Gone.

330
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,470
化成原子了
Reduced to atoms.

331
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:28,180
你两天前还用过的
You used them two days ago!

332
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,460
我用宝石摧毁了宝石
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

333
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,210
差点要了我的命
It nearly killed me.

334
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,880
但大业已成
But the work is done.

335
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,470
注定会完成的
It always will be.

336
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,180
我是宿命
I am inevitable.

337
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,750
我们得把这里翻个底朝天  他肯定在撒谎
We have to tear this place apart. He has to be lying!

338
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,360
我父亲有很多特点
My father is many things.

339
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,690
但他不撒谎
A liar is not one of them.

340
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,450
谢谢你  女儿
Thank you, daughter.

341
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,660
也许我过去对你太残酷了
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

342
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:11,790
什么
What?

343
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,670
你干了什么
What did you do?

344
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,220
我砍脑袋了
I went for the head.

345
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,830
那个...我...
So, I...

346
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:33,370
前两天去约会了
went on a date the other day.

347
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,310
这是五年来第一次
It's the first time in five years.

348
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,090
我坐在餐桌前
You know? I'm sitting there at dinner.

349
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,800
都不知道该谈些什么
I didn't even know what to talk about.

350
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,720
你们谈了什么
What did you talk about?

351
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,220
还是老一套  时过境迁了
Same old crap. You know, how things have changed.

352
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,730
我的工作  他的工作
My job, his job.

353
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,270
我们多想念纽约大都会队
How much we miss the Mets.

354
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,820
然后就陷入了沉默
And then things got quiet...

355
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,990
侍者上沙拉时  他哭了
then he cried as they were serving the salads.

356
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,610
那你呢
What about you?

357
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,160
我上甜点之前哭的
I cried just before dessert.

358
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,540
但我明天还要再见他  所以...
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...

359
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,580
很棒
That's great.

360
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,640
你已经完成了最难的部分  你鼓起勇气行动了
You did the hardest part. You took the jump.

361
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,500
尽管你不知道结果会如何
You didn't know where you were gonna come down.

362
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,270
就是这样
And that's it.

363
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:26,090
我们得这样勇敢地迈出一个个小步
That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take...

364
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,560
努力再次让自己完整  寻找意义
to try and become whole again, try and find purpose.

365
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:33,030
我1945年落入冰层中
I went in the ice in '45,

366
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,060
那时我才刚遇见自己的一生挚爱
right after I met the love of my life.

367
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,310
再醒来已是七十年后
Woke up 70 years later.

368
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,650
人得向前看
You gotta move on.

369
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,160
必须向前看
Gotta move on.

370
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,250
世界在我们手中
The world is in our hands.

371
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,580
就交给我们了  各位
It's left to us, guys.

372
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,250
我们得做点什么
And we gotta do something with it.

373
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,710
不然...
Otherwise...

374
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,970
灭霸就等于杀了所有人
Thanos should've killed all of us.

375
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,320
什么鬼
What the hell?

376
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,750
霍普
Hope?

377
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,470
孩子
Kid!

378
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,660
孩子
Hey, kid!

379
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,630
这里发生什么了
What the hell happened here?

380
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,450
天呐
Oh, my God!

381
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,010
拜托
Oh, please!

382
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,370
拜托
Please, please!

383
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,840
不不不不
No, no, no. No.

384
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,300
不
No.

385
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,270
不好意思  抱歉
Excuse me. Sorry.

386
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,430
凯西  不
Oh, Cassie, no.

387
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,180
不不不
No, no, no.

388
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:57,600
不不
No, no.

389
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,810
千万不要有凯西
Please, please, please. No, Cassie.

390
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,320
什么
What?

391
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,560
凯西
Cassie?

392
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:43,930
爸
Dad?

393
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,710
你长大了好多
You're so big!

394
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,580
我们登上了那艘
Yeah. We boarded that

395
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,660
丹弗斯说十分可疑的战舰
highly-suspect warship Danvers pinged.

396
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,580
那是一艘有传染病的垃圾驳船
It was an infectious garbage scow.

397
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:34,170
谢谢你的可靠情报
So, thanks for the hot tip.

398
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,500
你们更近嘛
Well, you were closer.

399
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,090
现在我们全身都是垃圾味
Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

400
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:38,760
你采集到震动读数了吗
You get a reading on those tremors?

401
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,550
是非洲板块下的轻微下冲
'Twas a mild subduction under the African plate.

402
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,680
能看到吗  要怎么处理
Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?

403
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,750
小娜
Nat.

404
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,210
只是海底地震
It's an earthquake under the ocean.

405
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:50,420
处理方式  就是不处理
We handle it by not handling it.

406
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,500
卡罗尔  下个月你会回来吗
Carol, are we seeing you here next month?

407
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,440
不太可能
Not likely.

408
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,400
怎么  你要再去剪一次头发吗
What? You gonna get another haircut?

409
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,880
听着  毛脸
Listen, fur face.

410
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,030
我要负责的地域很广
I'm covering a lot of territory.

411
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,700
发生在地球上的这些事
The things that are happening on Earth

412
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,350
到处都在发生
are happening everywhere.

413
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:05,120
在成千上万个星球上
On thousands of planets.

414
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,950
好吧  说得也是
All right, all right. That's a good point.

415
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,100
说得也是
That's a good point.

416
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,190
所以你们可能很长一段时间见不到我了
So, you might not see me for a long time.

417
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,020
好吧  那...
All right. Uh, well...

418
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:15,330
这个频道会一直开启
This channel's always active.

419
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,700
所以如果发生任何事
So, if anything goes sideways...

420
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,110
任何人在不该惹麻烦的地方制造麻烦
anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't...

421
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,160
都先通知我
comes through me.

422
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,680
-好  -好
- Okay.  - Okay.

423
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,700
那好
All right.

424
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,120
祝你好运
Good luck.

425
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,710
你在哪
Where are you?

426
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,810
墨西哥
Mexico.

427
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:40,720
联邦调查局发现了一房间的尸体
The Federales found a room full of bodies.

428
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,820
似乎是一群贩毒集团的人
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys...

429
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:44,650
甚至都没机会掏枪
never even had a chance to get their guns off.

430
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,470
八成是敌对帮派干的
I mean, it's probably a rival gang.

431
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,100
但不是
Except it isn't.

432
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,690
肯定是巴顿
It's definitely Barton.

433
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,190
他在这里做的事
What he's done here...

434
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,320
他过去几年里做的事
what he's been doing for the last few years...

435
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:58,490
他所留下的场面
I mean, the scene that he left...

436
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,090
我得说
I gotta tell you,

437
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:02,320
我心里都有点不想找到他
there's a part of me that doesn't even wanna find him.

438
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:10,330
你能查出他接下来要去哪吗
Will you find out where he's going next?

439
00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:15,500
小娜
Nat?

440
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,260
拜托了
Please?

441
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:21,880
好
Okay.

442
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:32,940
我倒想提出亲自给你下厨
You know, I'd offer to cook you dinner, but...

443
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,060
但你似乎已经很痛苦了
you seem pretty miserable already.

444
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,290
你是来洗衣服的吗
You here to do your laundry?

445
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,490
也来看看朋友
And to see a friend.

446
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,660
显然  你的朋友很好
Clearly, your friend is fine.

447
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,760
我过桥的时候
You know, I saw a pod of whales

448
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,010
看到了一群鲸鱼
when I was coming over the bridge.

449
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:52,010
在哈德逊河里吗
In the Hudson?

450
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,140
船只少了  水就清了
There's fewer ships... cleaner water.

451
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,250
如果你要跟我说
You know, if you're about to tell me

452
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:58,210
去看好的一面
to look on the bright side...

453
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,550
我就用花生酱三明治砸你的头
I'm about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich.

454
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,390
抱歉
Sorry.

455
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,810
旧习难改
Force of habit.

456
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:25,300
我一直告诉大家要放下过去
You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on...

457
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,530
继续生活
and grow.

458
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,450
有些人这么做了
Some do.

459
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,290
但是我们不行
But not us.

460
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,290
如果我放下过去  谁来做这些事
If I move on, who does this?

461
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,550
也许这些事不需要做
Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

462
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,800
以前我一无所有
I used to have nothing.

463
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,140
然后我拥有了这些
And then I got this.

464
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,890
这份工作
This job.

465
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:58,150
这个家庭
This family.

466
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,690
我因此
And I was

467
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,160
变得更好
I was better because of it.

468
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:16,290
虽然他们都不在了
And even though they're gone...

469
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,000
我还是在尽量变得更好
I'm still trying to be better.

470
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,720
我觉得我们俩都需要有点私生活
I think we both need to get a life.

471
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,680
你先来
You first.

472
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,700
有人在吗
Is anyone home?

473
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,610
我是斯科特·朗
This is, uh, Scott Lang.

474
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,860
我们几年前在机场见过
We met a few years ago at the airport...

475
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,030
德国的机场
in Germany?

476
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,010
我是那个变大的人  我当时戴了面具
I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on.

477
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,670
-你们大概认不出我  -这是以前的信息吗
- You wouldn't recognize me. - Is this an old message?

478
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,970
蚁人  我知道你们知道我
Ant-Man? I know you know... I know you know that.

479
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,710
-那是前门  -我真的需要和你们谈谈
- It's the front gate.  - I really need to talk to you guys.

480
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,630
斯科特
Scott.

481
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,860
你没事吧
Are you okay?

482
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,760
我没事
Yeah.

483
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:11,050
你们俩学过量子物理学吗
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics?

484
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:13,180
只有一点点了解
Only to make conversation.

485
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,310
好吧  是这样...
All right, so...

486
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,020
五年前  就在...
five years ago, right before...

487
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,810
灭霸的事发生前...
Thanos...

488
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,110
我进入了一个叫量子域的地方
I was in a place called the quantum realm.

489
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,050
量子域有它自己的微观宇宙
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe.

490
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,200
要想进去  你得变得非常非常小
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.

491
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,700
霍普  她是我的...
Hope. She's my, um...

492
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,240
她本是我的...
She was my...

493
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,430
她本应该把我拉出来的
She was supposed to pull me out.

494
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,140
然后灭霸的事发生了...
And then Thanos happened...

495
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:40,250
我就被困在里面了
and I got stuck in there.

496
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:42,270
很遗憾  这五年一定很漫长
I'm sorry, that must have been a very long five years.

497
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,540
是啊  问题就在这里
Yeah, but that's just it.

498
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,130
并不漫长
It wasn't.

499
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,810
对我来说  只有五个小时
For me, it was five hours.

500
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:48,190
量子域的法则
See, the rules of the quantum realm

501
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,400
跟这个世界不一样
aren't like they are up here.

502
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,070
一切都不可预测
Everything is unpredictable.

503
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,440
那个三明治有人要吗
Is that anybody's sandwich?

504
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,720
我饿死了
I'm starving.

505
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,180
斯科特
Scott.

506
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,930
你说的是什么意思
What are you talking about?

507
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,560
所以...
So...

508
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,440
我想说的是...
what I'm saying is...

509
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,940
在量子域里  时间有不同的运行方式
time works differently in the quantum realm.

510
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,530
唯一的问题是  现在
The only problem is right now

511
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,590
我们没法在其中定位
we don't have a way to navigate it.

512
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,740
但如果有办法呢
But what if we did?

513
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:11,130
我一直在思考这个
I can't stop thinking about it.

514
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,630
如果我们能想办法控制这种混沌
What if we could somehow control the chaos...

515
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:14,630
并在其中定位呢
and we could navigate it?

516
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,380
如果我们有办法
What if there was a way...

517
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:18,050
在某个特定时间点
that we could enter the quantum realm

518
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,300
进入量子域
at a certain point in time...

519
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,810
然后在另一个特定时间点
but then exit the quantum realm

520
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,390
离开量子域呢
at another point in time?

521
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,250
比如说
Like...

522
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,460
-在灭霸打响指之前  -等等
- Like before Thanos. - Wait.

523
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,340
你指的是时间机器吗
Are you talking about a time machine?

524
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,270
不  不  当然不是  不是时间机器
No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine.

525
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,590
这更像是...
This is more like a...

526
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:36,200
没错  就是时间机器
Yeah. Like a time machine.

527
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,220
我知道  这很疯狂  非常疯狂
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy.

528
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:40,280
但我就一直在思考这个
But I can't stop thinking about it.

529
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,560
肯定有...
There's gotta be...

530
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,770
办法的...
some way...

531
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,580
-是很疯狂  -斯科特
- It's crazy. - Scott.

532
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,290
我能收到一只浣熊发的邮件
I get emails from a raccoon...

533
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:49,650
所以  再没什么算是"疯狂"了
so nothing sounds crazy anymore.

534
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:52,200
那么  我们要跟谁讨论这个
So, who do we talk to about this?

535
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,300
开饭咯
Chow time!

536
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,050
摩古娜
Maguna.

537
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,100
摩根·H·斯塔克  你想吃午饭吗
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch?

538
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,370
定义一下"午饭"  不然
Define "lunch" or be

539
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,730
-就等着被灭吧  -好吧
- disintegrated. - Okay.

540
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,830
你不应该戴这个  好吗
You should not be wearing that, okay?

541
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,580
这是我给妈妈做的周年纪念
That is part of a special anniversary gift

542
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,860
特别礼物里的
I'm making for Mom.

543
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,740
好了  想吃午饭吗
There you go. You thinking about lunch?

544
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,220
我可以拿莴苣包一把蟋蟀给你
I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.

545
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,040
-不  -你不是想吃那个吗
- No. - That's what you want.

546
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,550
你怎么找到这个的
How did you find this?

547
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,310
-在车库里  -真的吗
- Garage. - Really?

548
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:46,540
-你是有意去找它的吗  -没有
- Were you looking for it? - No.

549
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,840
反正我找到了
I found it, though.

550
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,020
你喜欢进车库是吗
You like going in the garage, huh?

551
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:52,670
爸爸也是
So does Daddy.

552
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,260
其实没关系  我给妈妈买的礼物她从来不穿
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her.

553
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,930
那么  我要...
So, I'm gonna...

554
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,170
不  我们知道这听上去多疯狂
No. We know what it sounds like.

555
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,510
托尼  在经历过这一切之后
Tony, after everything you've seen,

556
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:23,390
-难道还真有不可能的事吗  -量子波动
- is anything really impossible? - Quantum fluctuation

557
00:34:23,390 --> 00:34:24,720
达到普朗克尺度
messes with the Planck scale...

558
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,430
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}大卫·德将量子理论与多重宇宙理论结合
提出回到过去只是进入另一个平行宇宙

559
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,430
并引出德氏观点
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition.

560
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:27,750
我们能认同这一点吗
Can we agree on that?

561
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,850
谢谢
Thank you.

562
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,540
通俗地讲  就是你无法回到这里了
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.

563
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,650
-我回来了  -不对
- I did. - No.

564
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:34,210
你是碰巧幸存了
You accidentally survived.

565
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,800
这是十亿分之一的宇宙侥幸
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke.

566
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,550
现在你想进行...
And now you wanna pull a...

567
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,430
你怎么说的来着
What do you call it?

568
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,620
时间盗窃
A time heist?

569
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,030
没错  时间盗窃  当然了
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

570
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,480
我们之前怎么没想到呢
Why didn't we think of this before?

571
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,080
因为这太好笑了  简直是白日梦
Because it's laughable. Because it's a pipe dream.

572
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,820
无限宝石都在过去
The stones are in the past.

573
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,540
我们可以回去拿到它们
We could go back, we could get them.

574
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,880
我们可以自己打响指  把所有人带回来
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.

575
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,130
或者让事情变得更糟  对吗
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?

576
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,670
我觉得我们不会的
I don't believe we would.

577
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,830
不得不说  有时我还挺怀念你的乐观
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism.

578
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,760
然而  如果没有合理可行的方法
However, high hopes won't help

579
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,890
来安全地进行所谓的时间盗窃
if there's no logical, tangible way

580
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:10,850
寄予厚望也没用
for me to safely execute said time heist.

581
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:12,520
我认为最可能的后果
I believe the most likely outcome

582
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,560
就是我们共同灭亡
will be our collective demise.

583
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,590
只要我们严格遵守时间旅行的规则就不会
Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel.

584
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:19,530
就是说  不可以跟过去的自己交谈
All right? It means no talking to our past selves...

585
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:20,900
不可以给体育比赛下注
no betting on sporting events.

586
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:23,310
我得让你打住了  斯科特
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott.

587
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,370
你真要跟我说
Are you seriously telling me

588
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,950
你拯救宇宙的计划
that your plan to save the universe...

589
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:29,100
是基于《回到未来》的吗
is based on Back to the Future?

590
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,980
-是吗  -不是
- Is it? - No.

591
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,080
很好  你刚刚害我有点担忧
Good. You had me worried there.

592
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,230
因为那就扯淡了
'Cause that would be horseshit.

593
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,710
量子物理的原理不是那样的
That's not how quantum physics works.

594
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,610
托尼
Tony.

595
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,620
我们必须奋起抗争
We have to take a stand.

596
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:44,530
我们抗争了  但还是落得这个地步
We did stand. And yet, here we are.

597
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,100
我知道你有很多顾虑
I know you got a lot on the line.

598
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:50,040
你有妻子  女儿
You got a wife, a daughter.

599
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,880
但我也失去了对我非常重要的人
But I lost someone very important to me.

600
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,960
很多人都是
A lotta people did.

601
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,190
而现在  我们有机会让她回来
And now, now we have a chance to bring her back...

602
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,570
让所有人回来
to bring everyone back,

603
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:00,900
而你却告诉我  你甚至都不...
and you're telling me that you won't even...

604
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,010
是的  斯科特  我甚至都不
That's right, Scott. I won't even.

605
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:05,890
我做不到
I can't.

606
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,390
妈妈让我来救你
Mommy told me to come and save you.

607
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,110
干得好  你救下我了
Good job. I'm saved.

608
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:15,920
我真希望你们是来问我其他事的
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else.

609
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,110
什么都行
Anything else.

610
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,920
我真的很高兴见到你们  我只是...
I'm honestly happy to see you guys, I just...

611
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,210
对了  我们准备了六人份的午餐
Oh, look, the table's set for six.

612
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,030
托尼  我懂
Tony. I get it.

613
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,320
我为你高兴  真的
And I'm happy for you. I really am.

614
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,120
但这是我们的第二次机会
But this is a second chance.

615
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,580
我的第二次机会就在这儿呢  队长
I got my second chance right here, Cap.

616
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,330
我不能拿她冒险
Can't roll the dice on it.

617
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,750
只要不谈工作  你们可以留下来用午餐
If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.

618
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,090
他害怕了
Well, he's scared.

619
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:41,680
他没有错
He's not wrong.

620
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:43,900
是啊  但是  我们该怎么办
Yeah, but, I mean, what are we, what are we, what are we gonna do?

621
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,640
我们需要他  我们就这么放弃吗
We need him. What, are we gonna stop?

622
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,010
不  我想把这事做好
No, I wanna do it right.

623
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,230
我们需要一个大大脑
We're gonna need a really big brain.

624
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,190
比他的还大吗
Bigger than his?

625
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:57,790
别这样  怎么好像就我一个人在吃
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating here.

626
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,860
尝尝那个
Try some of that.

627
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,320
来点炒蛋
Have some eggs.

628
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,880
我好困惑
I'm so confused.

629
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,410
现在就是令人困惑的年代
These are confusing times.

630
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,590
是啊  不  不  我不是那个意思
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant.

631
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,700
我懂啦  我开玩笑的
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

632
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,620
我知道  这很疯狂
I know, it's crazy.

633
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,220
我都开始穿衬衫了
I'm wearing shirts now.

634
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,460
是啊  什么  怎么会  为什么
Yeah. What? How? Why?

635
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,960
五年前  我们惨败
Five years ago, we got our asses beat.

636
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,020
只不过我更惨
Except it was worse for me...

637
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,520
因为我输了两次
'cause I lost twice.

638
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,840
先是绿巨人输了  后来班纳又输了
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost...

639
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,690
再后来  我们都输了
and then, we all lost.

640
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:27,240
没人怪你  布鲁斯
No one blamed you, Bruce.

641
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,140
我怪
I did.

642
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,620
这么多年来  我一直把绿巨人
For years, I've been treating the Hulk

643
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,950
当成一种疾病
like he's some kind of disease...

644
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,140
一种需要摆脱的东西
something to get rid of.

645
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,900
但后来  我开始视他为出路
But then, I start looking at him as the cure.

646
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,540
我在伽马实验室待了18个月
Eighteen months in the gamma lab.

647
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:43,240
把思想和力量融为了一体
I put the brains and the brawn together...

648
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,990
现在看看我
and now, look at me.

649
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,490
两个自我的最佳状态
Best of both worlds.

650
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,340
-打扰一下  绿巨人先生  -什么事
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk? - Yes.

651
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,830
我们能跟你合影吗
Can we get a photo?

652
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,050
当然可以  小朋友
100%, little person.

653
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,290
来  站过来  能帮个忙吗
Come on, step on up. Do you mind?

654
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:57,330
-当然  -谢谢
- Oh, yeah, yeah. - Thanks.

655
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,040
说"绿"
Say "Green."

656
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,060
-绿  -绿
- Green. - Green.

657
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,980
拍到了吗
Did you get that?

658
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,090
拍得很好
That's a good one.

659
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,640
你们也想跟我合个影吗  我是蚁人
Did you want to grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.

660
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,610
他们是绿巨人的粉丝
They're Hulk fans.

661
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,780
-他们不知道蚁人  -等等  不  不
- They don't know Ant-Man. - Wait. No, no.

662
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,080
-他难过了  -没人知道
- He feel bad. - Nobody...nobody does.

663
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,280
-他想跟你们...  -我不想合影
- No, he wants you...  - I don't want a picture.

664
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,830
-他想跟你们合影  -陌生人很危险
- He wants you to take a picture with him. - Stranger danger.

665
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:18,700
你看  他都说不要了
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't.

666
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:21,080
-我懂  我也不想  -别这样  那孩子
- I get it. I don't want it, either. - But come on, the kid, but...

667
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,380
-我不想跟他们合影  -可你...
- I don't want a picture with them. - But you...

668
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:23,580
-他会难过的  -抱歉
- He's gonna feel bad. - Sorry.

669
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,710
他们乐意的  他们说愿意了
They're happy to do it. They said they'll do it.

670
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,000
-我不想合影  -我们可以拍的
- I don't want to do it. - We can do it.

671
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,670
-不  你难过了  -把手机拿走
- No, you...you feel bad. - Take the goddamn phone.

672
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:29,530
好吧
Okay.

673
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,930
-谢谢你  绿巨人先生  -不用谢  孩子们
- Thank you, Mr. Hulk. - No, it was great, kids.

674
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,340
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

675
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:35,000
绿巨人来了
Hulk out!

676
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,120
布鲁斯
Bruce.

677
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,750
Dab手势
Dab.

678
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,540
-布鲁斯  -要听妈妈的话
- Bruce. - Listen to your mom.

679
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,940
她最懂了
She knows better.

680
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,090
关于我们刚刚谈到的
About what we were saying.

681
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,670
好吧
Right.

682
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,220
时间旅行重来一次的事
The whole time travel do-over?

683
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,270
各位  这不是我专长的领域
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise.

684
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,890
这事你都搞定了
Well, you pulled this off.

685
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,480
我记得这曾经也看似不可能
I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too.

686
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,910
我有个小灵感
I've got a mild inspiration.

687
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,220
我想看看行不行得通
I'd like to see if it checks out.

688
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,580
所以  今晚收工前
So, I'd like to run one last sim

689
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,310
我想再做一次模拟
before we pack it in for the night.

690
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:43,500
这一次  以莫比乌斯环的形态
This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip,

691
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,870
请逆转
inverted, please.

692
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,400
正在处理
Processing.

693
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,000
好吧  把那个粒子的特征值
Right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle

694
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,260
进行光谱分解
factoring in spectral decomp.

695
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,660
-这会需要点时间  -请稍等
- That'll take a second. - Just a moment.

696
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:00,250
不成功也没事  我只是...
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda...

697
00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:03,540
模型渲染完毕
Model rendered.

698
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:15,970
该死
Shit!

699
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,560
该死
Shit!

700
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,620
你怎么起来了  小丫头
What are you doing up, little miss?

701
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,540
-该死  -不  我们不能说那种话
- Shit. - Nope. We don't say that.

702
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:26,750
只有妈妈可以说那个词
Only Mommy says that word.

703
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,580
那是她创造的  是她的专属词
She coined it. It belongs to her.

704
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,590
你怎么还不睡
Why are you up?

705
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,590
因为我还有大事要做
'Cause I've got some important shit going on here!

706
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,340
要不然呢
Why do you think?

707
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,050
不  我有心事
No, I got something on my mind.

708
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:35,660
我有心事
I got something on my mind.

709
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,370
是果汁冰棍吗
Was it juice pops?

710
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,790
是的
Sure was.

711
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,180
这是敲诈  敲诈是个词
That's extortion. That's a word.

712
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,170
你想要什么味的
What kind you want?

713
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,520
英雄所见略同
Great minds think alike.

714
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,380
果汁冰棍  正是
Juice pops exactly was on

715
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,970
我心里所想
my mind.

716
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:53,680
吃完了吗  不要了
You done? Yeah?

717
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,930
现在没了
Now you are.

718
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,890
来  擦擦嘴
Here. Wipe.

719
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:02,330
很好  躺下吧
Good. That face goes there.

720
00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:03,730
给我讲个故事
Tell me a story.

721
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,810
讲故事
A story.

722
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:08,000
从前  摩古娜上床睡觉  讲完了
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.

723
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,880
-这故事太糟糕了  -怎么了
- That is a horrible story. - Come on,

724
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,360
这是你最爱的故事
that's your favorite story.

725
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,360
超级爱你[爱你好多吨]
Love you tons.

726
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,160
我爱你三千
I love you 3,000.

727
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:29,960
三千  这数真大
3,000. That's crazy.

728
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,800
快睡觉  不然我把你玩具全卖了
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys.

729
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:34,800
晚安
Night night.

730
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,940
虽然这不是竞争
Not that it's a competition...

731
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:39,240
但她爱我三千哦
but she loves me 3,000.

732
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,070
是吗
Does she, now?

733
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:43,980
你大概也就在六百到九百之间吧
You were somewhere in the low 6 to 900 range.

734
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,480
你在看什么
Whatcha reading?

735
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,500
关于堆肥的书
Just a book on composting.

736
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,360
堆肥有什么新门道
What's new with composting?

737
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,740
-有趣的科学...  -我想出来了
- Interesting science... - I figured it out.

738
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,620
顺便说一句
By the way.

739
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,620
我们是在聊同一件事吗
And, you know, just so we're talking about the same thing...

740
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:06,420
时间旅行
Time travel.

741
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:08,710
什么
What?

742
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,510
这...
That's...

743
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,390
太惊人了
amazing and

744
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,100
也很可怕
terrifying.

745
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,140
是啊
That's right.

746
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,610
我们真的很幸运
We got really lucky.

747
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:32,820
是啊
Yeah.

748
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,240
我知道
I know.

749
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,670
很多人可没这么幸运
A lot of people didn't.

750
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:37,280
对  我也不可能帮助所有人
Nope. And I can't help everybody.

751
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,670
看来你可以
Sorta seems like you can.

752
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,660
除非我停手
Not if I stop.

753
00:42:43,350 --> 00:42:46,120
我可以马上收手不干
I can put a pin in it right now and stop.

754
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:47,790
托尼
Tony...

755
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,380
劝你收手
trying to get you to stop...

756
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,250
是我这辈子少数做不到的事之一
has been one of the few failures of my entire life.

757
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,300
我有几分觉得  我该把它
Something tells me I should put it in a

758
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:02,720
锁进盒子里  沉进湖底
lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake...

759
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,350
然后上床睡觉
and go to bed.

760
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,820
但你能安心睡着吗
But would you be able to rest?

761
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,490
好  准备好  时间旅行测试1
Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one.

762
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:24,450
斯科特  启动
Scott, fire up...the, uh,

763
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,540
车里那玩意
van thing.

764
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,040
断路器已安装好
Breakers are set.

765
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,890
紧急发电机已就绪
Emergency generators are on standby.

766
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:33,390
很好  因为如果我们烧断了电网
Good, because if we blow the grid,

767
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,020
我可不想把小不点丢在上世纪五十年代
I don't want to lose, uh, Tiny here in the 1950s.

768
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,760
-你说什么  -他在开玩笑呢
- Excuse me? - He's kidding.

769
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,360
你不能说这种话
You can't say things like that.

770
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,970
就是个冷笑话而已
It was a bad joke.

771
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:46,870
你是在开玩笑  对吧
You were kidding, right?

772
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:50,040
我不知道  这可是时间旅行
I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here.

773
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,360
要么就是玩笑  要么就是玩完
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

774
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,690
我们准备好了
We're good!

775
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,650
戴上你的头盔
Get your helmet on.

776
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,380
斯科特  我要把你送回一周之前
Scott, I'm gonna send you back a week...

777
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,920
让你待一个小时
let you walk around for an hour,

778
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,950
然后10秒后带你回来
then bring you back in 10 seconds.

779
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,160
懂吗
Make sense?

780
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,800
完全明白
Perfectly not confusing.

781
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,120
祝你好运  斯科特  你能行的
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

782
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,290
你说得对
You're right.

783
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:11,710
我能行的  美国队长
I do, Captain America.

784
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:14,810
三秒倒计时
On a count of three...

785
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:19,050
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

786
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,220
各位
Guys?

787
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,660
这感觉不对劲
This doesn't feel right.

788
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:27,240
怎么回事
What is this?

789
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,320
-这是怎么了  -那是谁
- What's going on? - Who is that?

790
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,160
-等等  -那是斯科特吗
- Hold on. - Is that Scott?

791
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,440
当然是了
Yes, it's Scott.

792
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:35,580
-怎么回事  布鲁斯  -我的背
- What's going on, Bruce? - Oh, my back!

793
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,790
-这又怎么回事  -等等的
- What is this? - Hold on a second.

794
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:38,040
-能让让吗  -当然
- Could I get a little space here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

795
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,130
你能把他变回来吗
Can you bring him back?

796
00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:40,280
我在努力呢
I'm working on it.

797
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:48,220
是个婴儿
It's a baby.

798
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,050
-是斯科特  -婴儿的斯科特
- It's Scott. - As a baby.

799
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,640
-他会长大的  -把斯科特变回来
- He'll grow. - Bring Scott back.

800
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,310
我说断电时  就断电
When I say kill the power, kill the power.

801
00:44:53,310 --> 00:44:54,290
天呐
Oh, my God.

802
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,920
准备...断电
And... kill it!

803
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:02,840
有人尿在我裤子里了
Somebody peed my pants.

804
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:03,980
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

805
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,390
但我不确定是婴儿的我  还是老年的我
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me.

806
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,830
还是就是我
Or just me me.

807
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:14,310
时间旅行啊
Time travel!

808
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:18,900
怎么了
What?

809
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:22,990
我觉得这绝对是成功啊
I see this as an absolute win.

810
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:09,780
干吗拉个脸
Why the long face?

811
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:11,700
我猜猜  他变成婴儿了
Let me guess, he turned into a baby.

812
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:15,010
还不止  对  你怎么来了
Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?

813
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:16,870
是爱波罗悖论
It's the EPR Paradox.

814
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:18,560
你们没能让朗在时间里移动
Instead of pushing Lang through time,

815
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,890
而是让时间在朗身上流动了
you might've wound up pushing time through Lang.

816
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,770
这很不好弄  很危险
It's tricky, dangerous.

817
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:23,760
真该有人提醒你注意的
Somebody could have cautioned you against it.

818
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:24,880
你提醒了
You did.

819
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:26,300
是吗
Oh, did I?

820
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,470
幸好我来了
Well, thank God I'm here.

821
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:30,850
不管怎样  我解决了
Regardless, I fixed it.

822
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:34,100
完全好用的时间空间定位仪
A fully functioning time-space GPS.

823
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:37,350
我只想要和平
I just want peace.

824
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:41,730
原来怨恨会腐蚀心灵  我讨厌它
Turns out resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.

825
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,360
我也是
Me, too.

826
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:46,380
我们有机会拿到宝石
We got a shot at getting these stones,

827
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,570
但我得告诉你我最看重什么
but I gotta tell you my priorities.

828
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:51,120
找回我们失去的  希望可以
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes.

829
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:54,040
留住我得到的  我必须  不惜一切
Keep what I found, I have to, at all costs.

830
00:46:55,310 --> 00:46:57,830
或许  不用杀身成仁
And maybe not die trying.

831
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,250
那样最好了
Would be nice.

832
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,800
听上去不错
Sounds like a deal.

833
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,420
托尼  这好吗
Tony, I don't know.

834
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,320
怎么了
Why?

835
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:30,240
这是他为你造的
He made it for you.

836
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,090
而且  说实在的  我得赶紧从车库里取出来
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage

837
00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:34,990
不然要被摩根拿去滑着玩了
before Morgan takes it sledding.

838
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,460
谢谢  托尼
Thank you, Tony.

839
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,000
你能别声张吗
Will you keep that a little quiet?

840
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:46,380
我可没给全队都带礼物来
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

841
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:51,050
是全队都来吧
We are getting the whole team, yeah?

842
00:47:51,530 --> 00:47:53,100
我们正在集结人手呢
We're working on that right now.

843
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:12,490
人类
Hey, Humie.

844
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:14,370
大绿呢
Where's Big Green?

845
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,950
在厨房里吧
The kitchen, I think.

846
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:19,290
好赞啊
That's awesome.

847
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,830
罗德  降落时小心
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

848
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:24,790
降落区有个白痴
There's an idiot in the landing zone.

849
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:27,000
天呐
Oh, God.

850
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,420
好啊  普通大小的哥们
What's up, Regular-Sized Man?

851
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,490
跟金宫殿  魔法锤比
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces

852
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,660
差远了啊
and the magic hammers and whatnot.

853
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,290
有点同情心嘛  伙计
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.

854
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,500
他们先失去了阿斯加德  然后又失去了半数人民
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people.

855
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:30,130
他们大概有个家就很开心了
They're probably just happy to have a home.

856
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,780
你们不该来的
You shouldn't have come.

857
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,090
女武神
Valkyrie!

858
00:49:35,090 --> 00:49:37,870
见到你真高兴  生气姑娘
Great to see you, angry girl!

859
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:40,910
我觉得你另外两个形态哪个都比这样好
I think I liked you better either of the other ways.

860
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:42,300
这是火箭
This is Rocket.

861
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:43,160
你好
How ya doing?

862
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,000
他不会见你们的
He won't see you.

863
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:48,350
那么糟吗
It's that bad, huh?

864
00:49:48,350 --> 00:49:49,650
我们每月只能见到他一次
We only see him once a month

865
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,380
在他来取"补给"时
when he comes in for "supplies."

866
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:54,900
那么糟啊
It's that bad.

867
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,800
是啊
Yeah.

868
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:09,980
搞什么
What the...?

869
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,070
这里面一股腐臭
Something died in here!

870
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,240
有人吗  托尔
Hello? Thor!

871
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,530
你是来修电视的吗
Are you here about the cable?

872
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:23,450
电影频道两周前就收不到了
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago and...

873
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,670
体育频道也都模模糊糊的
the sports are all kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

874
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:28,210
托尔
Thor?

875
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:39,100
伙计们  天呐
Boys! Oh, my God!

876
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,390
天呐  见到你们太好了
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you!

877
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:45,020
过来  你这可爱的小坏蛋
Come here, cuddly little rascal.

878
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,520
别了  别介了
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

879
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,330
真没必要
That's not necessary.

880
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:52,080
绿巨人  你认识我的朋友米克和寇格吧
Hulk, you know my friends Miek and Korg, right?

881
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:53,540
-你们好  -你们好
- Hey, boys! - Hey, guys.

882
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,880
好久没见
Long time no see.

883
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:55,920
啤酒在桶里
Beer's in the bucket.

884
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,500
有无线网  自己登吧
Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi.

885
00:50:57,510 --> 00:50:59,410
没有密码的
No password, obviously.

886
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:01,620
托尔  他又来了
Thor, he's back.

887
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:04,200
电视上那小子刚刚又喊我蠢货了
That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again.

888
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:06,540
新手大师
Noobmaster.

889
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,430
对  新手大师69
Yeah, NoobMaster69

890
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,130
-喊我蠢货  -我受够了
- called me a dickhead. - I am sick of this.

891
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:12,640
新手大师  还是托尔
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again.

892
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,020
雷神哦
You know, the God of Thunder.

893
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,110
听着  伙计  如果你不马上退出游戏
Listen, buddy, if you don't log off this game immediately,

894
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,770
我就飞去你家
I am gonna fly over to your house,

895
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,780
冲进你正躲在的地下室里
come down to that basement you're hiding in,

896
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,470
扯掉你的胳膊  塞进你屁眼里
rip off your arms, and shove them up your butt!

897
00:51:22,530 --> 00:51:23,570
没错
Oh, that's right, yes!

898
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:25,890
去你爸那儿哭吧  小混蛋
Go cry to your father, you little weasel.

899
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:27,240
谢谢  托尔
Thank you, Thor.

900
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,910
他再敢欺负你就告诉我  好吗
Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?

901
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:30,600
非常感谢  我会的
Thank you very much. I will.

902
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,620
你们想喝点啥吗  我们喝什么
So, you guys want a drink? What are we drinking?

903
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:35,320
我有啤酒  龙舌兰  什么都有
I've got beer, tequila, all sorts of things.

904
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:38,860
伙计
Buddy.

905
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:42,120
-你没事吧  -嗯  我没事  怎么了
- You all right? - Yes, I'm fine. Why?

906
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,720
我看上去不好吗
Why, don't I look all right?

907
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,330
你看上去像融化的冰淇淋
You look like melted ice cream.

908
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,420
怎么  你就是来玩的吗
So, what's up? You just here for a hang, or what?

909
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:50,750
我们需要你帮忙
We need your help.

910
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,060
我们或许有机会修复一切
There might be a chance we could fix everything.

911
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,500
电视吗
What, like the cable?

912
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,900
因为这事折磨我几周了
'Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.

913
00:51:57,900 --> 00:51:59,130
是灭霸
Like Thanos.

914
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:21,240
别提那个名字
Don't say that name.

915
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:24,870
是啊  我们这里不提那个名字的
Yeah, we don't actually say that name in here.

916
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,710
请把你的手拿开
Please take your hand off me.

917
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,130
我知道那...家伙
Now, I know that guy...

918
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:40,130
可能让你害怕
might scare you.

919
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:41,430
怎么会呢
Why would I be...?

920
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:44,680
我怎么会怕那家伙
Why would I be scared of that guy?

921
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:47,260
是我杀了那家伙  记得吗
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember?

922
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,060
这里有别人杀他了吗
Anyone else here kill that guy?

923
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,440
没有
Nope.

924
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:56,650
我猜也是
Didn't think so.

925
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,240
寇格  你跟大家说说
Korg, why don't you, uh, tell everybody

926
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,700
是谁砍掉了灭霸的大脑袋
who chopped Thanos' big head off?

927
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:02,960
风暴斧吗
Stormbreaker?

928
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,070
那是谁挥的风暴斧
Who was swinging Stormbreaker?

929
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:11,350
我懂的  你心里很难过
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?

930
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,560
我也经历过
I've been there myself.

931
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,380
知道是谁帮我走出来的吗
And you want to know who helped me out of it?

932
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:17,380
是娜塔莎吗
Was it Natasha?

933
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,090
是你
It was you.

934
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,220
是你帮了我
You helped me.

935
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,890
那你怎么不去问问
So, why don't you ask...

936
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:27,720
下面的阿斯加德人
the Asgardians down there...

937
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,810
我的帮助有多少价值
how much my help is worth?

938
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,270
至少是还剩下的那些
The ones that are left, anyway.

939
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,110
我觉得我们能把他们找回来
I think we could bring them back.

940
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,820
住口
Stop.

941
00:53:41,790 --> 00:53:43,200
别说了  好吗
Stop, okay?

942
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,920
我知道你觉得我是待在这里
I know you think I'm down here

943
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,880
沉湎于自怨自艾之中
wallowing in my own self-pity...

944
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,510
等着有人来拯救
waiting to be rescued and saved...

945
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,890
但我没事  好吗  我们都没事  是吧
but I'm fine, okay. We're fine, aren't we?

946
00:53:51,890 --> 00:53:52,890
我们很好  伙计
Oh, we're good here, mate.

947
00:53:52,890 --> 00:53:55,560
所以  不管你有什么提议  我们不感兴趣
So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it.

948
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,290
不在乎  完全不在乎
Don't care. Couldn't care less.

949
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,340
再见
Goodbye.

950
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:03,050
我们需要你  伙计
We need you, pal.

951
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,440
船上有啤酒
There's beer on the ship.

952
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,110
哪种的
What kind?

953
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:07,880
我想要的
What I want

954
00:56:09,070 --> 00:56:10,340
你给不了
you can't give me.

955
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:35,240
你不该来的
You shouldn't be here.

956
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,910
你也不该
Neither should you.

957
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:47,090
我有工作要做
I've got a job to do.

958
00:56:48,690 --> 00:56:50,220
你管这叫工作吗
Is that what you're calling this?

959
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,720
杀这些人也不能让你的家人回来
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.

960
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:00,890
我们有发现
We found something.

961
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,360
或许是一线希望
A chance, maybe.

962
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:08,690
别
Don't.

963
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,990
别什么
Don't what?

964
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,570
别给我希望
Don't give me hope.

965
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:21,370
很抱歉我没能早点给你
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.

966
00:57:43,410 --> 00:57:44,560
你左偏了
You're drifting left.

967
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:46,810
小心点  督爷
One side there, Lebowski.

968
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,360
火贱  干得怎么样了
Ratchet, how's it going?

969
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:52,500
是火箭
It's Rocket.

970
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:55,660
你放尊敬点  你只在地球上是天才  伙计
Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.

971
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:01,950
时间旅行服  不赖啊
Time travel suit, not bad.

972
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:04,760
小心点
Easy! Easy!

973
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:05,890
我很小心了
I'm being very careful.

974
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,520
不  你很绿巨人
No, you're being very Hulky.

975
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:08,310
我很小心了
I'm being careful.

976
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,980
这可是皮姆粒子
These are Pym Particles, all right?

977
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,190
因为汉克·皮姆已被响指打消失了
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence,

978
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:12,810
我们只剩这些了
this is it.

979
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,900
我们只有这么多  我们再造不出更多了
This is what we have. We're not making any more.

980
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:16,930
-斯科特  冷静  -抱歉
- Scott, calm down. - Sorry.

981
00:58:17,070 --> 00:58:20,030
我们只够每人往返一次  再就没了
We've got enough for one round-trip each. That's it.

982
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:21,030
不能重来
No do-overs.

983
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,270
还能做两次测试
Plus two test runs.

984
00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:28,980
一次测试
One test run.

985
00:58:29,790 --> 00:58:31,710
好吧  我没准备好呢
All right. I'm not ready for this.

986
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:32,530
我愿意
I'm game.

987
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,070
我去吧
I'll do it.

988
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,790
克林特  你会因时移
Clint, now you're gonna feel a little

989
00:58:38,790 --> 00:58:40,430
而感到有些混乱
discombobulated from the chronoshift.

990
00:58:40,430 --> 00:58:41,090
不用担心的
Don't worry about that.

991
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,720
等等  我问你件事
Wait, wait, wait a second. Let me ask you something.

992
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,120
如果我们能做到
If we can do this, you know...

993
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:46,890
回到过去  何不去找到婴儿灭霸
go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos?

994
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:47,710
然后...
You know, and...

995
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,560
首先  这太黑暗了
First of all, that's horrible.

996
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,270
那是灭霸啊
It's Thanos.

997
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:56,610
其次  时间不是那样的
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.

998
00:58:56,610 --> 00:58:59,030
改变过去不能改变未来
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

999
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:00,530
我们回到过去  赶在灭霸之前
Look, we go back, we get the stones

1000
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:01,910
拿到宝石
before Thanos gets them...

1001
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:04,620
灭霸就拿不到宝石了  问题解决
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.

1002
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:06,620
-是啊  -原理不是这样的
- Bingo. - That's not how it works.

1003
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,660
我听说是这样的
Well, that's what I heard.

1004
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,000
谁  谁说的
Wait, but who? Who told you that?

1005
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,210
《星际迷航》《终结者》《时间警察》
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop...

1006
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:12,710
-《两世奇人》  -《量子跳跃》
- Time After Time. - Quantum Leap.

1007
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:13,960
《时间的皱折》《时光倒流七十年》
Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.

1008
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:14,790
《热浴盆时光机》
Hot Tub Time Machine.

1009
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:16,090
《热浴盆时光机》
Hot Tub Time Machine.

1010
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,500
《比尔和泰德历险记》
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.

1011
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:20,090
基本上所有讲时间旅行的电影都是这样的
Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.

1012
00:59:20,090 --> 00:59:21,840
《虎胆龙威》  不对  那个不是
Die Hard. No, that's not one.

1013
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,880
这是已知定律
This is known.

1014
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,390
我不知道为什么大家都相信那个
I don't know why everyone believes that,

1015
00:59:24,390 --> 00:59:25,430
但那不是真的
but that isn't true.

1016
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:27,720
想想看  如果你回到过去
Think about it. If you travel to the past...

1017
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,890
那过去就是你的未来了
that past becomes your future...

1018
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:33,270
你之前的现在  就成了过去
and your former present becomes the past...

1019
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,900
它是不能被你的新未来改变的
which can't now be changed by your new future.

1020
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,970
没错
Exactly.

1021
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:40,220
所以《回到未来》就是胡扯吗
So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit?

1022
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,230
好  克林特
All right, Clint.

1023
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,690
准备  三  二
We're going in three, two...

1024
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:50,900
一
one.

1025
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,600
库珀
Cooper?

1026
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,560
-我的耳机呢  -莱拉
- Where are my headphones? - Lila?

1027
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:09,160
-我没拿  -莱拉
- I never had them. - Lila?

1028
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,270
你昨天拿了
Yeah, you had them yesterday!

1029
01:01:12,910 --> 01:01:14,560
莱拉  莱拉
Lila! Lila!

1030
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:20,900
怎么了  爸爸
Yeah, Dad?

1031
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,530
爸爸
Dad?

1032
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,370
莱拉
Lila!

1033
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:37,980
看着我
Look at me.

1034
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:38,800
你没事吧
You okay?

1035
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:40,670
没事
Yeah.

1036
01:01:41,190 --> 01:01:42,130
没事
Yeah.

1037
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,470
成功了
It worked.

1038
01:01:46,610 --> 01:01:47,430
成功了
It worked.

1039
01:01:50,990 --> 01:01:52,940
好  办法可行
Okay, so the how works.

1040
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:56,940
现在我们得确定时间和地点
Now, we gotta figure out the when and the where.

1041
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,620
这房间里几乎每个人都曾遭遇过
Almost everyone in this room has had an encounter

1042
01:01:59,630 --> 01:02:01,210
六颗无限宝石中的至少一颗
with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.

1043
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:02,880
也可以把"遭遇"
Or substitute the word "encounter"

1044
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,090
换成"差点被六颗
for "damn near been killed"

1045
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:05,800
无限宝石中的一颗害死"
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

1046
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,870
我没有
Well, I haven't...

1047
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,280
但我根本不知道你们在说什么
but I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.

1048
01:02:09,590 --> 01:02:10,740
不管怎样
Regardless,

1049
01:02:11,050 --> 01:02:12,470
我们剩的皮姆粒子
we only have enough Pym Particles

1050
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,560
只够每人往返一次
for one round-trip each.

1051
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:15,600
而这些宝石曾在
And these stones have been

1052
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:17,850
历史上很多不同的地方出现过
in a lot of different places throughout history.

1053
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:18,880
我们的历史
Our history.

1054
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:22,440
所以  我们刚好能去的地方不多  是吧
So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

1055
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:24,630
所以我们得选好目标
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1056
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:25,720
没错
Correct.

1057
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,550
那么
So,

1058
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:28,850
先从以太粒子说起
let's start with the Aether.

1059
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,430
托尔  你知道些什么
Thor, what do you know?

1060
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,060
他睡着了吗
Is he asleep?

1061
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:38,370
不不
No, no.

1062
01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:39,900
我肯定他是死了
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1063
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,190
从何说起呢
Where to start?

1064
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:49,240
以太粒子  首先  它不是宝石
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone.

1065
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,280
之前有人把它称为宝石
Someone called it a stone before.

1066
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:56,580
它更像是团愤怒的烂泥
It's more of an angry sludge sort of a thing, so

1067
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,470
得有人纠正一下
someone's gonna need to amend that

1068
01:02:58,480 --> 01:02:59,880
别再那么喊它了
and stop saying that.

1069
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:02,850
关于以太粒子  有个有趣的故事
Here's an interesting story, though, about the Aether.

1070
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,860
我祖父  很多年前
My grandfather, many years ago...

1071
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:08,640
不得不把宝石藏在了黑暗精灵找不到的地方
had to hide the stone from the Dark Elves.

1072
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,400
他们可吓人了
Scary beings.

1073
01:03:11,410 --> 01:03:13,470
简呢  其实
So, Jane, actually...

1074
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,180
她在这儿呢
There she is.

1075
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:19,060
是啊  简是我的老情人
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine.

1076
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:23,440
她有次把手伸进了一块石头里
You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time...

1077
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,570
以太粒子就进入了她体内
and then the Aether stuck itself inside her...

1078
01:03:26,590 --> 01:03:28,630
她就病得很重
and she became very, very sick.

1079
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:30,590
我不得不把她带回阿斯加德
And so I had to take her to Asgard,

1080
01:03:30,590 --> 01:03:31,840
我的家乡
which is where I'm from...

1081
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:33,640
我们只能想办法治好她
and we had to try and fix her.

1082
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:35,140
我们当时在约会
We were dating at the time, you see...

1083
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:38,620
我还把她介绍给了我妈妈
and I got to introduce her to my mother...

1084
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,130
她死了
who's dead and, um...

1085
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:48,230
然后简和我也分手了
Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, so...

1086
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,900
这种事难免嘛
Yes, these things happen, though. You know?

1087
01:03:49,900 --> 01:03:51,440
没什么能天长地久  唯一...
Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that...

1088
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:52,700
-你过来坐下吧  -我没说完呢
- Why don't you come sit down? - I'm not done yet.

1089
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,780
人生中唯一永久不变的
The only thing that is permanent in life

1090
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:56,220
就是它的无常
is impermanence.

1091
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,580
说得太好了  鸡蛋  吃早饭吗
Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?

1092
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,450
不了  我想喝杯血腥玛丽
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1093
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,480
奎尔说他是在莫拉格偷走了力量宝石
Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.

1094
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:07,900
-那是个人吗  -不  莫拉格是个星球
- Is that a person? - No, Morag's a planet.

1095
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,950
奎尔才是人
Quill was a person.

1096
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:13,050
星球  是在外太空吗
Like a planet? Like in outer space?

1097
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,410
看啊
Oh, look.

1098
01:04:14,470 --> 01:04:17,330
它就像只小狗  乐哈哈的
It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything.

1099
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,640
你想去太空吗  想去吗  狗狗
Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy?

1100
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,040
我可以带你去
I'll take you to space.

1101
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:25,520
灭霸在沃密尔星球上找到了灵魂宝石
Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1102
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,920
沃密尔星球是什么
What is Vormir?

1103
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,050
死亡之域
A dominion of death...

1104
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,010
天体存在的中心
at the very center of celestial existence.

1105
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:36,850
灭霸就在那里杀了我姐姐
It's where Thanos murdered my sister.

1106
01:04:43,620 --> 01:04:44,440
不去
Not it.

1107
01:04:46,330 --> 01:04:48,330
-那个时间宝石的家伙  -斯特兰奇博士
- That Time Stone guy. - Doctor Strange.

1108
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,130
他是什么博士[医生]来着
Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?

1109
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:52,300
耳鼻喉加帽子里抓兔子
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat.

1110
01:04:52,300 --> 01:04:53,760
他在格林威治有栋好房子
Nice place in the Village, though.

1111
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:54,990
对  是在苏利文街吗
Yeah, on Sullivan Street?

1112
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,950
-是布里克街  -等等  他住在纽约吗
- Bleecker Street. - Wait, he lived in New York?

1113
01:04:58,510 --> 01:04:59,850
-不  他住在多伦多  -对  布里克街
- No, he lived in Toronto. - Yeah, on Bleecker

1114
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:01,560
-和苏利文街  -你好没好好听啊
- and Sullivan. - Have you been listening to anything?

1115
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,540
伙计们
Guys.

1116
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,350
如果选对了年
If you pick the right year,

1117
01:05:04,350 --> 01:05:06,340
能在纽约找到三枚宝石
there are three stones in New York.

1118
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:10,220
不是吧
Shut the front door.

1119
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:15,010
好  我们有计划了
All right. We have a plan.

1120
01:05:15,450 --> 01:05:16,680
六颗宝石
Six stones,

1121
01:05:16,990 --> 01:05:18,010
三支队伍
three teams,

1122
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:20,020
一次机会
one shot.

1123
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,530
五年前  我们输了
Five years ago, we lost.

1124
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:33,910
我们都输了
All of us.

1125
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,370
我们失去了朋友
We lost friends.

1126
01:05:38,390 --> 01:05:39,540
我们失去了家人
We lost family.

1127
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:43,670
我们失去了一部分自我
We lost a part of ourselves.

1128
01:05:45,100 --> 01:05:47,250
今天  我们有机会夺回那一切
Today, we have a chance to take it all back.

1129
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:50,060
你们知道你们的分组
You know your teams.

1130
01:05:50,060 --> 01:05:51,380
也清楚你们的任务
You know your missions.

1131
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:53,360
拿回宝石
Get the stones.

1132
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:54,510
夺回一切
Get them back.

1133
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:56,740
每人往返一次
One round-trip each.

1134
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,680
不能犯错
No mistakes...

1135
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,640
不能重来
no do-overs.

1136
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:02,120
我们大部分人是要去熟悉的地方
Most of us are going somewhere we know.

1137
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,440
但那不代表我们知道会遭遇什么
That doesn't mean we should know what to expect.

1138
01:06:05,330 --> 01:06:06,310
要小心
Be careful.

1139
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,110
彼此照应
Look out for each other.

1140
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:11,400
这是今生最重要的一战
This is the fight of our lives...

1141
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:13,360
我们会赢的
and we're gonna win.

1142
01:06:16,010 --> 01:06:17,120
不惜一切
Whatever it takes.

1143
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:21,200
大家好运
Good luck.

1144
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:22,970
他真擅长这个
He's pretty good at that.

1145
01:06:22,970 --> 01:06:24,350
-是吧  -好了
- Right? - All right.

1146
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,140
大家听到了
You heard the man.

1147
01:06:25,140 --> 01:06:26,830
按键盘吧  绿色快递
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

1148
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,380
追踪器启动
Trackers engaged.

1149
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,980
你保证把它完好地带回来吧
You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?

1150
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:33,520
知道啦
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1151
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,340
好  我尽量
Okay, I'll do my best.

1152
01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:37,720
作为保证  这可不怎么样
As promises go, that was pretty lame.

1153
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:41,680
一分钟后见
See ya in a minute.

1154
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:37,460
好了  我们各有各的任务
All right, we all have our assignments.

1155
01:07:37,460 --> 01:07:39,360
两颗宝石在上城区  一颗在下城区
Two stones uptown, one stone down.

1156
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:41,620
低调点  注意时间
Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.

1157
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,630
随手砸点东西吧
Maybe smash a few things along the way.

1158
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:02,350
我觉得没必要  但随便了
I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.

1159
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,350
往那边走可要小心脚下
I'd be careful going that way.

1160
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:33,250
我们刚给地板打了蜡
We just had the floors waxed.

1161
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:40,590
我找斯特兰奇博士
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.

1162
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:44,600
你来早了大概五年
You're about five years too early.

1163
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,370
斯蒂芬·斯特兰奇现在正在那边大概
Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery

1164
01:08:47,370 --> 01:08:49,180
20个街区处做手术呢
about 20 blocks that way.

1165
01:08:50,740 --> 01:08:52,100
你找他要干什么
What do you want from him?

1166
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:54,230
要那个
That, actually.

1167
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:58,290
恐怕不行
I'm afraid not.

1168
01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:00,110
抱歉  但这不是请求
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1169
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:01,550
你不想这么做的
You don't want to do this.

1170
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:03,710
我是不想  但我需要那颗宝石
You're right, I don't. But I need that stone...

1171
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,240
我没时间跟你争了
and I don't have time to debate it.

1172
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:15,790
我们重新开始吧
Let's start over, shall we?

1173
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:28,350
给您的  简女士
For you, Lady Jane.

1174
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:31,430
你们有...裤装吗
Do you have anything with pants?

1175
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,350
裤装
Pants?

1176
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,830
算了  这个就行  谢谢
Never mind. These will be fine. Thank you.

1177
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:36,610
-是  女士  -简在那儿
- Yes, milady. - Oh, there's Jane.

1178
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:39,110
好了
All right.

1179
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,210
听好了  胖胖
Here's the deal, tubby.

1180
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:43,210
你来迷倒她
You're gonna charm her,

1181
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,550
我拿这个戳倒她
and I'm gonna poke her with this thing

1182
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:47,410
抽走现实宝石  然后就麻溜走人
and extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split.

1183
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:49,890
我马上回来  好吗
I'll be right back, okay?

1184
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:52,010
酒窖就在这边
The wine cellar is just down here.

1185
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:54,890
我父亲以前藏了几大桶的俄科尼麦芽酒
My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1186
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:57,040
我去碗碟室看看有没有外带杯
I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups.

1187
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,050
你不是已经喝醉了吗
Aren't you drunk enough already?

1188
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:07,110
麻烦你给洛基送点汤过去
If you could send Loki some soup.

1189
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:07,740
是  陛下
Yes, milady.

1190
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:08,950
叫我们的图书管理员
And ask our librarians

1191
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,890
去天文区拿几卷书来
to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf.

1192
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,520
那个贵气的女人是谁
Who's the fancy broad?

1193
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,030
我妈妈
That's my mother.

1194
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:24,240
她今天会死
She dies today.

1195
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:27,120
是今天吗
That is today?

1196
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:36,370
我做不到
I can't do this. I can't do this.

1197
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,130
我不该来的
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.

1198
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:39,750
这是个坏主意
It's a bad idea!

1199
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,020
-过来  -不不
- Come here. - No, no, no.

1200
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,690
我觉得我恐慌发作了
I think I'm having a panic attack.

1201
01:10:43,690 --> 01:10:45,070
-过来  -我不该来的
- Come here. - I shouldn't be here.

1202
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:46,010
-这里  -这不妙
- Right here. - This is bad.

1203
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:48,360
你以为只有你失去了人吗
You think you're the only one who lost people?

1204
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,050
你以为我们在干什么
What do you think we're doing here?

1205
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,360
我失去了我唯一曾拥有过的家庭
I lost the only family I ever had.

1206
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:55,330
奎尔  格鲁特  德拉克斯  触角妹
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna...

1207
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:56,440
都没了
all gone.

1208
01:10:57,250 --> 01:10:58,950
我理解你想你妈妈
I get you miss your mom...

1209
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:00,460
但她死了
but she's gone.

1210
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:01,620
真死了
Really gone.

1211
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:04,820
但还有很多人只是不在了
And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone...

1212
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,400
你可以帮他们
and you can help them.

1213
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,630
所以这个要求过分吗
So, is it too much to ask

1214
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:10,620
把你胡子里的食物渣子掸掉
that you brush the crumbs out of your beard...

1215
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:13,010
去哄那个漂亮妞
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants...

1216
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:16,430
趁她不备  吸走无限宝石
and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone...

1217
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:18,540
然后帮我找回家人
and help me get my family back?

1218
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,460
好
Okay.

1219
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,250
你哭了吗
Are you crying?

1220
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:23,710
没有
No.

1221
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:26,800
对
Yes.

1222
01:11:26,820 --> 01:11:28,360
我觉得我要不行了
I feel like I'm losing it.

1223
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:29,360
振作起来
Get it together!

1224
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:30,550
你可以的
You can do this.

1225
01:11:31,570 --> 01:11:33,060
你可以的
You can do this.

1226
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,140
好吗
All right?

1227
01:11:37,490 --> 01:11:38,560
我可以的
Yes, I can.

1228
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:39,480
很好
Good.

1229
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:44,110
我可以的
I can do this. I can do this.

1230
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:46,320
我做不到
I can't do this.

1231
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:48,340
好了  女人杀手  她现在就一个人
All right, heartbreaker, she's alone.

1232
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,570
我们的机会来了
This is our shot.

1233
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:50,820
托尔
Thor?

1234
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:52,700
托尔
Thor!

1235
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,630
好  降下来  小蓝
All right, bring it down, Blue.

1236
01:12:04,650 --> 01:12:06,800
对准那条线  没错  再往下
Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.

1237
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,280
能快点的吗
Can we hurry it up?

1238
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,470
各位  快点  我们赶时间呢
Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on the clock.

1239
01:12:15,490 --> 01:12:17,810
这么催真的很有帮助
All that is really helpful.

1240
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:21,230
-要小心  好吗  -嗯
- Take care, okay? - Yeah.

1241
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,610
拿到宝石就回来  别干别的
Get that stone and come back. No messing around.

1242
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:26,130
我们行的
We got this.

1243
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:27,330
-我们搞定这事吧  -好的
- Let's get it done. - Yes, sir.

1244
01:12:27,340 --> 01:12:28,280
回头见
I'll see you back.

1245
01:12:29,590 --> 01:12:31,410
你们彼此照应着点
You guys watch each other's six.

1246
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:32,320
嗯
Yeah.

1247
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,380
沃密尔星球的坐标已输入
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.

1248
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,670
他们只要不跌出来就行
All they have to do is not fall out.

1249
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:54,550
我们离布达佩斯可很远了
We're a long way from Budapest.

1250
01:12:59,700 --> 01:13:01,060
好吧
Okay, so, uh...

1251
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:05,790
我们就等着这个奎尔出现
we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

1252
01:13:05,790 --> 01:13:07,900
然后他就会带我们找到力量宝石  是吗
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1253
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:10,150
我们找掩护吧
Let's take cover.

1254
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,260
2014年时  我们不是唯一在找宝石的人
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1255
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:15,880
等等  你在说什么呢
Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now?

1256
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:17,490
还有谁在找宝石
Who else is looking for these stones?

1257
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:21,790
我父亲
My father...

1258
01:13:22,350 --> 01:13:23,420
我姐姐
my sister...

1259
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,340
和我
and me.

1260
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:26,670
还有你
And you?

1261
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:29,920
你现在在哪
Where are you right now?

1262
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:00,040
不客气
You're welcome.

1263
01:14:00,260 --> 01:14:02,540
我没叫你帮忙
I didn't ask for your help.

1264
01:14:03,100 --> 01:14:05,330
但你总需要我帮
And yet, you always need it.

1265
01:14:08,850 --> 01:14:11,230
起来  父亲要我们回飞船上
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.

1266
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:11,960
为什么
Why?

1267
01:14:12,230 --> 01:14:14,220
他找到了一颗无限宝石
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1268
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,430
在哪
Where?

1269
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,270
在一颗叫莫格拉的星球上
On a planet called Morag.

1270
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:25,770
父亲的计划总算开始运作了
Father's plan is finally in motion.

1271
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:27,750
一颗宝石可不比六颗  星云
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1272
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:28,980
这是个开始
It's a start.

1273
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,280
如果他能拿到全部...
If he gets all of them...

1274
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:45,890
罗南已找到了力量宝石
Ronan's located the Power Stone.

1275
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,770
我要派你们去他的飞船上
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

1276
01:14:47,770 --> 01:14:49,210
他不会高兴的
He won't like that.

1277
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:51,340
他不配合就得死
His alternative is death.

1278
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:54,510
罗南的执迷
Ronan's obsession...

1279
01:14:55,570 --> 01:14:57,510
影响了他的判断力
clouds his judgment.

1280
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,930
我们不会让你失望的  父亲
We will not fail you, Father.

1281
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,520
是啊  你不会的
No, you won't.

1282
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:10,980
我发誓
I swear...

1283
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:14,240
我会让你骄傲的
I will make you proud.

1284
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:25,970
我们就等着这个奎尔出现
...we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up...

1285
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:28,040
然后他就会带我们找到力量宝石  是吗
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?

1286
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:30,210
我们找掩护吧
Let's take cover.

1287
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:34,710
2014年时  我们不是唯一在找宝石的人
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.

1288
01:15:36,690 --> 01:15:37,800
那是谁
Who was that?

1289
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:39,030
我不知道
I don't know.

1290
01:15:39,030 --> 01:15:41,390
我头痛欲裂  我不知道
My head is splitting. I don't know.

1291
01:15:43,160 --> 01:15:46,060
她的突触驱动可能在打斗中损伤了
Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.

1292
01:15:56,290 --> 01:15:57,990
把她带上我的飞船
Bring her to my ship.

1293
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:06,800
快点吧  队长
Better hustle, Cap.

1294
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:08,720
这边看上去像是快要完事了
Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.

1295
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:10,880
收到  我正在往电梯去
Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.

1296
01:16:17,190 --> 01:16:18,930
如果你们不介意
If it's all the same to you...

1297
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:22,930
我现在想来一杯
I'll have that drink now.

1298
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,720
好  把他拉起来
All right, get him on his feet.

1299
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,560
我们稍后再傻站着摆姿势吧
We can all stand around posing up a storm later.

1300
01:16:27,870 --> 01:16:29,770
对了  你们可以收拾一下
By the way, feel free to clean up.

1301
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,620
罗杰斯先生  我差点忘了  那身战衣
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that that suit...

1302
01:16:32,620 --> 01:16:34,420
太不衬你的屁股了
did nothing for your ass.

1303
01:16:34,420 --> 01:16:35,870
你非得看吗  托尼
No one asked you to look, Tony.

1304
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,460
真荒唐
It's ridiculous.

1305
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,940
我觉得你很帅  队长
I think you look great, Cap.

1306
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:40,960
在我看来  那就是美国屁股
As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass.

1307
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,800
魔杖归谁
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

1308
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,530
突击队正在赶来收走它
S.T.R.I.K.E. Team's coming to secure it.

1309
01:16:55,060 --> 01:16:56,500
那个交给我们吧
We can take that off your hands.

1310
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,210
请吧
By all means.

1311
01:17:00,280 --> 01:17:01,510
小心哦
Careful with that thing.

1312
01:17:01,610 --> 01:17:03,650
是啊  除非你想被抹除思想
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased.

1313
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:04,780
而且可不好玩
And not in a fun way.

1314
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:05,990
我们一定小心
We promise to be careful.

1315
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,990
他们是谁
Who are these guys?

1316
01:17:06,990 --> 01:17:08,560
他们是神盾局的
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1317
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,790
但其实是九头蛇的  但我们当时不知道
Well, actually Hydra, but we didn't know that yet.

1318
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,600
真的吗  你们不知道
Seriously? You didn't? I mean,

1319
01:17:14,410 --> 01:17:15,710
他们一看就不像好人啊
they look like bad guys.

1320
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:17,460
你虽然个头小  但好聒噪
You're small, but you're talking loud.

1321
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,380
这就下去协调搜救工作
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

1322
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:21,670
这就下去协调搜救工作
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.

1323
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:24,340
真的  你怎么做到不吐的
I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down?

1324
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:25,660
闭嘴
Shut up.

1325
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,840
好  该你上了  小伙计
All right, you're up, little buddy.

1326
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:29,330
我们的宝石在那里呢
There's our stone.

1327
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:30,910
好
All right.

1328
01:17:31,470 --> 01:17:32,330
弹我
Flick me.

1329
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:47,350
让开
Move.

1330
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:49,410
伙计
Buddy!

1331
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:51,780
你怎么想的  已达到承载上限了
What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1332
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:52,450
走楼梯吧
Take the stairs.

1333
01:17:52,450 --> 01:17:54,560
是啊  别别
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1334
01:17:57,330 --> 01:18:00,190
"走楼梯"  讨厌楼梯
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs.

1335
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,340
好了  队长  权杖在电梯里
All right, Cap, I got our scepter in the elevator...

1336
01:18:06,340 --> 01:18:08,450
刚过80层
just passing the 80th floor.

1337
01:18:09,180 --> 01:18:10,200
知道了
On it.

1338
01:18:10,890 --> 01:18:11,760
去大堂
Head to the lobby.

1339
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:12,830
好  在那里碰头
All right, I'll see you there.

1340
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,540
证据已收押
Evidence secure.

1341
01:18:14,720 --> 01:18:16,290
我们这就去找李斯特博士
We're en route to Doctor List.

1342
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:19,960
不  毫无意外  部长先生
No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.

1343
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,110
队长
Captain.

1344
01:18:26,110 --> 01:18:28,140
我以为你去协调搜救行动了
I thought you were coordinating search and rescue.

1345
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:29,760
计划有变
Change of plans.

1346
01:18:33,740 --> 01:18:34,770
队长
Hey, Cap.

1347
01:18:36,370 --> 01:18:37,440
朗姆洛

1348
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,710
我刚接到了部长的电话
I just got a call from the secretary.

1349
01:18:45,710 --> 01:18:47,780
权杖的事将由我负责
I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.

1350
01:18:50,090 --> 01:18:52,580
长官  我不懂
Sir? I don't understand.

1351
01:18:54,810 --> 01:18:56,850
我们收到消息  可能有人会企图偷它
We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.

1352
01:18:56,850 --> 01:18:57,880
抱歉  队长
Sorry, Cap.

1353
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:00,130
我们不能把权杖给你
We can't give you the scepter.

1354
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:02,460
我得打给局长
I'm gonna have to call the director.

1355
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:04,760
没事  相信我
That's okay. Trust me.

1356
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:09,600
九头蛇万岁
Hail Hydra.

1357
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,860
好多楼梯啊
So many stairs!

1358
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:40,350
拇指姑娘  收到吗  我看到目标了
Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize.

1359
01:19:40,350 --> 01:19:41,520
可以开始了
It is go time.

1360
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,710
炸吧
Bombs away.

1361
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:52,450
那是AXE香氛吗
Is that Axe Body Spray?

1362
01:19:52,450 --> 01:19:55,070
对  我桌子里常备一罐应急的  放松啦
Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies. Relax.

1363
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,030
可以专心点吗
Can we focus, please?

1364

1366
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,380
可以问问你们要去哪吗
May I ask you where you're going?

1367
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:07,920
吃点午饭  然后去阿斯加德
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.

1368
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,000
抱歉  你是...
I'm sorry, you are...?

1369
01:20:09,010 --> 01:20:10,050
亚历山大·皮尔斯
Alexander Pierce.

1370
01:20:10,050 --> 01:20:12,420
他是尼克·弗瑞背后老大的老大
He's the man above the folks behind Nick Fury.

1371
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:14,010
我的朋友喊我部长先生
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

1372
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:16,620
我得请你把那位犯人交给我
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.

1373
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:18,640
洛基会去向奥丁做个交待的
Loki will be answering to Odin himself.

1374
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:19,810
不  他得向我们做交待
No, he's going to answer to us.

1375
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:21,020
我们审过了再给奥丁
Odin can have what's left.

1376
01:20:21,020 --> 01:20:22,380
我还要拿走那个箱子
And I'm gonna need that case.

1377
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:24,520
那七十多年来都是神盾局的财产
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D. property for over 70 years.

1378
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,840
交出箱子  斯塔克
Hand over the case, Stark.

1379
01:20:25,860 --> 01:20:27,080
好  行动吧  精灵鼠小弟
All right, move it, Stuart Little.

1380
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:28,220
这边情况有点麻烦了  快点的
Things are getting dicey out here. Let's go.

1381
01:20:28,270 --> 01:20:30,530
我不打算争论这里谁的权力更高
I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here...

1382
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,050
你保证你不会死吗
You promise me you won't die?

1383
01:20:32,110 --> 01:20:35,280
我们只是要让我稍稍心律失常
We're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1384
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:36,850
那听上去很暴力啊
That doesn't sound mild.

1385
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:37,780
我需要那个箱子
I need the case.

1386
01:20:37,780 --> 01:20:39,330
我知道你权力挺大的  我只是说
I know you got a lot of pull, I'm just saying,

1387
01:20:39,330 --> 01:20:40,580
-管辖权...  -好吧  那给我箱子
- jurisdiction... - Okay, then give me the case.

1388
01:20:40,580 --> 01:20:41,620
管辖权...
Well, jurisdiction...

1389
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,060
交出来
Hand it over.

1390
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:44,160
动手  朗
Do it, Lang!

1391
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:44,960
手拿开
Get your hands off me.

1392
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:46,860
快没时间了  拔线
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1393
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,280
来了
Here goes!

1394
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:52,820
-斯塔克  -斯塔克

1395
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:55,470
他在抽搐  给他点空间
He's convulsing. Give him air!

1396

-医务人员  -医务人员
- Medic! - Medic!

1397
01:20:57,680 --> 01:20:59,000
他们需要帮助
Give these guys some help.

1398
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:00,410
说话啊
Speak to me.

1399
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:02,920
斯塔克  是你的胸口机器吗
Stark, is it your chest machine?

1400
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:06,880
呼吸
Breathe, breathe.

1401
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,280
好样的  巷子里见
Good job. Meet me in the alley.

1402
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,680
我去找点吃的
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1403
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:22,440
不走楼梯
No stairs!

1404
01:21:29,710 --> 01:21:31,290
拜托  斯塔克  保持清醒
Come on, Stark, stay with us.

1405
01:21:31,300 --> 01:21:32,210
我要试个办法  好吗
I'm going to try something. Okay?

1406
01:21:32,210 --> 01:21:33,570
我也不知道行不行
I have no idea if it's going to work.

1407
01:21:36,010 --> 01:21:36,760
好啊
Yes!

1408
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:37,990
非常行啊
That worked a treat.

1409
01:21:38,220 --> 01:21:39,140
哥们  真疯狂
Dude, that was so crazy.

1410
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,660
我完全不知道那行不行
I had no idea if that was gonna work.

1411
01:21:40,970 --> 01:21:42,580
-箱子呢  -箱子
- The case. - The case is, uh...

1412
01:21:42,890 --> 01:21:45,080
箱子呢  洛基呢
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

1413
01:21:45,810 --> 01:21:46,750
洛基
Loki!

1414
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:48,190
那不符合计划  是吧
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?

1415
01:21:48,190 --> 01:21:49,420
我们搞砸了
Oh, we blew it.

1416
01:21:49,860 --> 01:21:51,050
洛基
Loki?

1417
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:54,800
托尼  怎么回事
Tony, what's going on?

1418
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:57,050
告诉我你找到魔方了
Tell me you found that Cube.

1419
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,060
开什么玩笑
You gotta be shitting me.

1420
01:22:05,540 --> 01:22:07,980
看到洛基了  14楼
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

1421
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:09,280
我不是洛基
I'm not Loki...

1422
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:14,530
我也不想伤害你
and I don't wanna hurt you.

1423
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:24,600
我可以和你耗一整天
I can do this all day.

1424
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:25,750
我知道
Yeah, I know.

1425
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,080
我知道
I know.

1426
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,370
你从哪拿到的
Where did you get this?

1427
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:13,100
巴基
Bucky

1428
01:23:13,110 --> 01:23:13,920
还
is

1429
01:23:14,020 --> 01:23:15,090
活着
alive.

1430
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:19,470
什么
What?

1431
01:23:34,630 --> 01:23:36,280
确实是美国屁股
That is America's ass.

1432
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:42,110
-拜托了  -对不起
- Please, please. - I'm sorry,

1433
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:43,740
我帮不了你  布鲁斯
I can't help you, Bruce.

1434
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:45,930
如果我交出时间宝石
If I give up the Time Stone

1435
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:48,140
帮助你的现实  就是毁了我的现实
to help your reality, I'm dooming my own.

1436
01:23:48,140 --> 01:23:49,680
恕我直言
With all due respect, all right...

1437
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:53,050
我觉得科学并不支持你这个说法
I'm not sure the science really supports that.

1438
01:23:58,610 --> 01:24:00,070
无限宝石
The Infinity Stones

1439
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:02,930
创造了你所感知的时间流
create what you experience as the flow of time.

1440
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:04,720
如果拿走一颗宝石
Remove one of the stones...

1441
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:06,640
就会产生支流
and that flow splits.

1442
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,480
这或许对你的现实有好处
Now, this may benefit your reality...

1443
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:12,190
但对我新的这个  就不好了
but my new one, not so much.

1444
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:14,290
在这个新的支流现实里
In this new branch reality...

1445
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:15,830
没有了我们对抗
without our chief weapon

1446
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,570
黑暗力量的首要武器
against the forces of darkness...

1447
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:19,630
我们的世界会被颠覆
our world would be overrun.

1448
01:24:19,630 --> 01:24:21,370
数百万人会蒙受灾难
Millions will suffer.

1449
01:24:21,630 --> 01:24:23,120
告诉我  博士
So, tell me, Doctor.

1450
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:25,800
你的科学能阻止这一切吗
Can your science prevent all that?

1451
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:26,700
不能
No...

1452
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,060
但我们可以抹除它
but we can erase it.

1453
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:30,850
因为我们用完宝石后
Because once we're done with the stones...

1454
01:24:30,850 --> 01:24:33,100
我们可以把每一颗拿回原来的时间点
we can return each one to its own timeline...

1455
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:34,730
放回被拿走的那一刻
at the moment it was taken.

1456
01:24:34,730 --> 01:24:37,130
这样  从时间上讲
So, chronologically...

1457
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:40,180
在那个现实里
in that reality...

1458
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,300
它就根本没被拿走过
it never left.

1459
01:24:46,200 --> 01:24:48,850
是啊  但你漏掉了最重要的部分
Yes, but you're leaving out the most important part.

1460
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:55,370
要还回宝石  你们得能幸存下来
In order to return the stones, you have to survive.

1461
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:58,320
我们会的  我会的  我保证
We will. I will. I promise.

1462
01:24:58,710 --> 01:25:01,280
我不能为了一句承诺拿这个现实冒险
I can't risk this reality on a promise.

1463
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:05,220
至尊法师有责任
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme

1464
01:25:05,220 --> 01:25:07,240
保护时间宝石
to protect the Time Stone.

1465
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,830
那斯特兰奇为什么把它交了出去
Then why the hell did Strange give it away?

1466
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:12,430
你说什么
What did you say?

1467
01:25:12,430 --> 01:25:15,380
斯特兰奇  他把宝石交给了灭霸
Strange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.

1468
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:17,340
-自愿的吗  -是的
- Willingly? - Yes.

1469
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:22,780
-为什么  -我不知道
- Why? - I have no idea.

1470
01:25:22,780 --> 01:25:24,340
或许他错了
Maybe he made a mistake.

1471
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:36,110
或是我错了
Or I did.

1472
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:58,800
斯特兰奇将成为我们中最优秀的
Strange is meant to be the best of us.

1473
01:25:59,150 --> 01:26:01,670
所以他那么做肯定是有原因的
So, he must've done it for a reason.

1474
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,090
你恐怕是对的
I fear you might be right.

1475
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:09,810
谢谢
Thank you.

1476
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:18,150
我指望你了  布鲁斯
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1477
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:21,190
我们都指望你了
We all are.

1478
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:43,300
运行诊断
Run diagnostics.

1479
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:45,590
给我看她的记忆文件
Show me her memory file.

1480
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:50,140
大人  文件似乎凌乱了
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1481
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,310
虽然有段记忆  但不属于她
It was a memory, but not hers.

1482
01:26:54,370 --> 01:26:57,060
还有另一个意识在与她共享网络
There's another consciousness sharing her network.

1483
01:26:57,660 --> 01:26:59,150
另一个星云
Another Nebula.

1484
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:02,530
不可能
Impossible.

1485
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:05,360
这个二重身有时间戳
This duplicate carries a time stamp...

1486
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,370
是九年后的
from nine years in the future.

1487
01:27:13,140 --> 01:27:15,460
另一个星云在哪
Where is this other Nebula?

1488
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:19,000
在我们太阳系里的莫格拉上
In our solar system on Morag.

1489
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,230
你能读取她吗
Can you access her?

1490
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:23,050
能  她俩是相连的
Yes, the two are linked.

1491
01:27:23,480 --> 01:27:25,630
搜索那个二重身的记忆
Search the duplicate's memories...

1492
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:27,970
找无限宝石
for Infinity Stones.

1493
01:27:31,530 --> 01:27:32,700
而这些宝石曾在
And these stones have been

1494
01:27:32,700 --> 01:27:34,910
历史上很多不同的地方出现过
in a lot of different places throughout history.

1495
01:27:34,910 --> 01:27:36,270
我们的历史  所以
Our history. So,

1496
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:38,870
我们刚好能去的地方不多  是吧
not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah?

1497
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:41,080
所以我们得选好目标
Which means we have to pick our targets.

1498
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:42,730
-没错  -定格
- Correct. - Freeze image.

1499
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:46,070
地球人
Terrans.

1500
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,530
复仇者
Avengers.

1501
01:27:49,470 --> 01:27:51,280
无法无天的讨厌鬼
Unruly wretches.

1502
01:27:51,590 --> 01:27:53,160
那个倒影是什么
What's that reflection?

1503
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:56,160
放大它  乌木喉
Amplify this, Maw.

1504
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:00,420
我不懂
I don't understand.

1505
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:06,820
两个星云
Two Nebulas.

1506
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:09,550
不  是一个星云
No. The same Nebula...

1507
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:11,890
来自两个时间
from two different times.

1508
01:28:13,070 --> 01:28:14,820
设置航向去莫格拉
Set course for Morag.

1509
01:28:14,820 --> 01:28:16,850
并扫描那个二重身的记忆
And scan the duplicate's memories.

1510
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:20,350
我想看到一切
I wanna see everything.

1511
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:32,090
女士们  稍后见
My ladies, I'll see you after.

1512
01:28:32,090 --> 01:28:33,870
你们先去吧
I'll see you after. Go on ahead.

1513
01:28:48,190 --> 01:28:49,220
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1514
01:28:50,730 --> 01:28:52,070
天呐
Oh, God!

1515
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:54,700
偷偷摸摸这种事最好还是交给你弟弟
You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.

1516
01:28:54,700 --> 01:28:57,200
我没偷偷摸摸  我就是出来走走
No, I wasn't sneaking. I was just going for a walk.

1517
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,070
你穿的是什么啊
What are you wearing?

1518
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,770
我总穿这件的  我最喜欢了
I always wear this. It's one of my favorites.

1519
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:06,330
你的眼睛怎么了
What's wrong with your eye?

1520
01:29:06,330 --> 01:29:07,170
我的眼睛
Oh, my eye.

1521
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:09,460
记得海拉根战役吗
Remember the, uh, Battle of Harokin...

1522
01:29:09,460 --> 01:29:12,240
我被大刀击中了脸
when I got hit in the face with the broadsword?

1523
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:18,750
你根本不是我认识的托尔  是吧
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?

1524
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:20,210
我是的
Yes, I am.

1525
01:29:21,350 --> 01:29:24,000
看来未来对你很不好  是吧
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?

1526
01:29:24,060 --> 01:29:26,170
我没说我是未来来的
I didn't say I was from the future.

1527
01:29:26,650 --> 01:29:28,800
我是被女巫养大的  孩子
I was raised by witches, boy.

1528
01:29:30,110 --> 01:29:32,800
我看东西不光靠眼睛  你知道的
I see with more than eyes, you know that.

1529
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:36,990
是啊  我就是从未来来的
Yeah, I'm totally from the future.

1530
01:29:36,990 --> 01:29:38,990
是啊  亲爱的
Yes, you are, honey.

1531
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:40,680
我真的需要跟你谈谈
I really need to talk to you.

1532
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:41,730
我们可以谈谈
We can talk.

1533
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:07,670
他的脑袋在这边
His head was over there...

1534
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,010
他的身体在另一边
and his body over there...

1535
01:30:12,070 --> 01:30:14,430
有什么意义呢  我太迟了
I mean, what was the point? I was too late.

1536
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,850
我就傻站在那里
I was just standing there.

1537
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:19,570
一个拿着斧头的白痴
Some idiot with an axe.

1538
01:30:19,570 --> 01:30:21,730
你才不是白痴
Now, you're no idiot.

1539
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:23,980
你不是来这儿了吗
You're here, aren't you?

1540
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:27,110
向阿斯加德最睿智的人寻求建议
Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.

1541
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:28,360
是啊
I am. Yes.

1542
01:30:28,370 --> 01:30:29,730
不是白痴
Idiot, no.

1543
01:30:30,080 --> 01:30:31,440
失败呢
A failure?

1544
01:30:31,630 --> 01:30:33,000
的确
Absolutely.

1545
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,250
这有点残忍了吧
That's a little bit harsh.

1546
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:36,070
知道那意味着你什么吗
Do you know what that makes you?

1547
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:39,160
跟其他人一样
Just like everyone else.

1548
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:41,910
我不是该与众不同的吗
I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?

1549
01:30:42,930 --> 01:30:46,250
每个人都会辜负他人的期待  托尔
Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be, Thor.

1550
01:30:46,890 --> 01:30:49,590
衡量一个人  一个英雄的标准
The measure of a person, of a hero...

1551
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:53,340
是他们能把真实的自己做得多好
is how well they succeed at being who they are.

1552
01:30:58,650 --> 01:30:59,970
我真的好想你  妈妈
I've really missed you, Mom.

1553
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:08,110
托尔  我拿到了
Thor! I got it!

1554
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:09,980
抓住那只兔子
Get that rabbit!

1555
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:15,000
妈妈  我有事要告诉你
Mom, I have to tell you something.

1556
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,660
不  儿子  你不用说
No, son, you don't.

1557
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,760
你是来修复你的未来的  不是我的
You're here to repair your future, not mine.

1558
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,080
-这就是关于你的未来  -那我管不着
- This is about your future.  - It's none of my business.

1559
01:31:28,060 --> 01:31:29,840
你就是妈妈吧
You must be Mom.

1560
01:31:30,440 --> 01:31:32,310
我拿到了  我们得走了
I got the thing. Come on. We gotta move.

1561
01:31:32,310 --> 01:31:33,560
真希望我们还有时间
I wish we had more time.

1562
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,840
不  这已是恩赐
No, this was a gift.

1563
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:38,680
你去做你该成为的那个人吧
Now you go and be the man you're meant to be.

1564
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:40,740
我爱你  妈妈
I love you, Mom.

1565
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:42,060
我爱你
I love you.

1566
01:31:46,200 --> 01:31:48,100
吃点蔬菜吧
And eat a salad.

1567
01:31:49,080 --> 01:31:50,520
好了  我们得走了
Come on, we gotta go.

1568
01:31:50,660 --> 01:31:51,820
-再见  -三
- Goodbye. - Three...

1569
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:53,480
-二  -不  等等
- Two... - No, wait!

1570
01:31:56,750 --> 01:31:57,800
什么情况啊
What am I looking at?

1571
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,990
有时得需要点时间
Sometimes it takes a second.

1572
01:32:09,270 --> 01:32:10,460
我还有资格
I'm still worthy.

1573
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:13,340
天呐
Oh, boy.

1574
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:17,170
-再见  妈妈  -再见
- Goodbye, Mom. - Goodbye.

1575
01:32:56,230 --> 01:32:57,510
所以  他是个白痴吗
So, he's an idiot?

1576
01:32:59,110 --> 01:33:00,340
对
Yeah.

1577
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,190
那是什么
What's that?

1578
01:33:10,330 --> 01:33:11,850
贼的工具
The tool of a thief.

1579
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,010
按说这时候就会有尖刺冒出来
This is the part where you know, spikes come out...

1580
01:33:24,010 --> 01:33:25,630
上面还插着骷髅
with skeletons on the end of them and everything.

1581
01:33:25,630 --> 01:33:26,430
你在说什么啊
What are you talking about?

1582
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:27,800
当你闯入什么
When you break into a place called

1583
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,350
"力量宝石神殿"时
"The Temple of the Power Stone"...

1584
01:33:29,350 --> 01:33:30,810
肯定会有一堆陷阱的
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps.

1585
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:32,670
-天呐  -好吧  行啊  你去吧
- Oh, my God. - Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1586
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:08,120
我并不一直是如此的
I wasn't always like this.

1587
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:09,910
我也一样
Me either.

1588
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:13,370
但我们只能尽力而为了  是吧
But we work with what we got, right?

1589
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:18,040
我们同步吧
Let's sync up.

1590
01:34:20,230 --> 01:34:22,470
三  二  一
Three, two, one.

1591
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,210
你杀了数万亿生灵
You murdered trillions!

1592
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:38,820
你应该感激
You should be grateful.

1593
01:34:40,580 --> 01:34:42,360
宝石在哪
Where are the stones?

1594
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:43,320
没了
Gone.

1595
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:45,760
化成原子了
Reduced to atoms.

1596
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,660
你两天前还用过的
You used them two days ago!

1597
01:34:47,720 --> 01:34:50,680
我用宝石摧毁了宝石
I used the stones to destroy the stones.

1598
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,890
差点要了我的命
It nearly killed me.

1599
01:34:52,890 --> 01:34:54,710
但大业已成
But the work is done.

1600
01:34:54,890 --> 01:34:57,170
注定会完成的
It always will be.

1601
01:34:57,980 --> 01:35:01,630
我是宿命
I am inevitable.

1602
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:04,510
你对他们做了什么
What did you do to them?

1603
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:06,010
没什么
Nothing.

1604
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:08,300
还没做呢
Yet.

1605
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:11,820
他们不是想阻止我要在
They're not trying to stop something

1606
01:35:11,820 --> 01:35:13,810
我们的时间里做的事
I'm going to do in our time.

1607
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:16,120
他们是想撤销我已在
They're trying to undo something

1608
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:18,040
他们的时间里做了的事
I've already done in theirs.

1609
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,270
宝石
The stones.

1610
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:22,070
我全拿到了
I found them all.

1611
01:35:24,170 --> 01:35:25,360
我赢了
I won.

1612
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:29,530
让宇宙天平平衡了
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance.

1613
01:35:33,510 --> 01:35:35,160
这是你的未来
This is your future.

1614
01:35:35,510 --> 01:35:37,210
是我的命运
It's my destiny.

1615
01:35:38,770 --> 01:35:40,380
我父亲有很多特点
My father is many things.

1616
01:35:40,940 --> 01:35:42,670
但他不撒谎
A liar is not one of them.

1617
01:35:46,570 --> 01:35:48,090
谢谢你  女儿
Thank you, daughter.

1618
01:35:48,360 --> 01:35:51,050
也许我过去对你太残酷了
Perhaps I treated you too harshly.

1619
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:58,100
那就是实现了命运
And that is destiny fulfilled.

1620
01:35:58,580 --> 01:35:59,650
大人
Sire...

1621
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,270
你女儿
your daughter...

1622
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:04,730
不
No!

1623
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:06,340
是个叛徒
...is a traitor.

1624
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:09,030
那不是我  我绝不会的
That's not me. It's not, I could never...

1625
01:36:09,050 --> 01:36:10,340
我绝不会背叛你
I would never betray you.

1626
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:12,080
绝不会
Never. Never.

1627
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,210
我知道
I know.

1628
01:36:20,180 --> 01:36:22,670
你会有机会证明的
And you'll have the chance to prove it.

1629
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:30,590
不
No!

1630
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:32,510
他知道了
He knows!

1631
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,390
巴顿  回复
Barton! Barton, come in.

1632
01:36:39,910 --> 01:36:40,900
罗曼诺夫
Romanoff!

1633
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:43,190
回复  我们有麻烦了
Come in, we have a problem.

1634
01:36:43,330 --> 01:36:44,190
拜托
Come on!

1635
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:45,650
回复  我们...
Come in, we have a...

1636
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:47,320
灭霸知道了
Thanos knows.

1637
01:36:48,250 --> 01:36:49,240
灭霸
Thanos...

1638
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:04,090
队长
Cap.

1639
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:07,960
抱歉  伙计  我们有麻烦了
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.

1640
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:10,050
是啊
Yeah, we do.

1641
01:37:10,820 --> 01:37:11,860
我们这下怎么办
Well, what are we gonna do now?

1642
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,030
饶了我吧  史蒂夫
You know what? Give me a break, Steve.

1643
01:37:13,030 --> 01:37:14,640
我刚被绿巨人砸了脑袋
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.

1644
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:16,410
你说我们只有一次机会的
You said that we had one shot.

1645
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:17,950
这就是我们的机会
This was our shot.

1646
01:37:17,950 --> 01:37:19,200
我们试了  没机会了
We shot it. It's shot.

1647
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:20,030
六颗宝石  不然就不行
Six stones or nothing.

1648
01:37:20,040 --> 01:37:20,620
六颗宝石  不然就不行
It was six stones or nothing.

1649
01:37:20,620 --> 01:37:21,910
你在重复自己的话  知道吗
You're repeating yourself, you know that?

1650
01:37:21,910 --> 01:37:22,500
你在重复自己的话
You're repeating yourself.

1651
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,210
你才在重复自己的话
You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself.

1652
01:37:24,210 --> 01:37:25,210
-不  -哥们
- You know, no. - Dude.

1653
01:37:25,210 --> 01:37:26,790
-行了  -你当初就不想进行时间盗窃
- Come on! - You never wanted a time heist.

1654
01:37:26,790 --> 01:37:27,830
你不赞成时间盗窃
You weren't on board with the Time Heist.

1655
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:29,090
-我搞砸了  -你毁了时间盗窃
- I dropped the ball. - You ruined the Time Heist.

1656
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:30,250
-是吗  -是啊
- Is that what I did? - Yeah.

1657
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:32,050
宇宙魔方还有其他选择吗
Are there any other options with the Tesseract?

1658
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:34,050
没了  没有其他选择
No, no, no, there's no other options.

1659
01:37:34,050 --> 01:37:35,050
没法重来
There's no do-overs.

1660
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:37,590
我们别想去别的地方了  我们只剩一剂粒子了
We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left.

1661
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:38,550
每人一剂
Each.

1662
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:41,000
就这些了  好吗  我们用了
That's it. All right? We use that...

1663
01:37:41,060 --> 01:37:42,350
再见了  别想回家了
bye-bye, you're not going home.

1664
01:37:42,350 --> 01:37:44,040
如果我们不试试
Yeah, well, if we don't try...

1665
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,350
那别人也都别想回家了
then no one else is going home, either.

1666
01:37:46,350 --> 01:37:47,250
我知道了
I got it.

1667
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:50,110
还有别的办法能拿到宇宙魔方
There's another way to retake the Tesseract

1668
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:52,510
并拿到更多粒子
and acquire new particles.

1669
01:37:53,030 --> 01:37:54,680
回忆一下
Little stroll down memory lane.

1670
01:37:54,700 --> 01:37:56,890
军队设施  花园之州
Military installation, Garden State.

1671
01:38:00,780 --> 01:38:01,950
它们什么时候同时都在
When were they both there?

1672
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:04,850
它们都在...我大致知道是什么时候
They were there at a time... I have a vaguely exact idea.

1673
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,500
-多大致  -你们在说什么
- How vague? - What are you talking about?

1674
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:07,210
我们去哪
Where are we going?

1675
01:38:07,210 --> 01:38:08,920
-我确定它们在那里  -什么它们
- I know for a fact they were there. - Who's they?

1676
01:38:08,920 --> 01:38:10,360
-我们要干什么  -我也知道我怎么知道的
- What are we doing? - And I know how I know.

1677
01:38:12,550 --> 01:38:13,910
伙计们  怎么回事
Guys, what is it?

1678
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:16,380
看来我们得即兴发挥了
Looks like we're improvising.

1679
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,800
-好  -什么即兴发挥
- Great. - What are we improvising?

1680
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:20,010
斯科特  把这个拿回基地
Scott, get this back to the compound.

1681
01:38:20,010 --> 01:38:20,870
准备
Suit up.

1682
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,510
-新泽西有什么  -04
- What's in New Jersey? - 0-4.

1683
01:38:22,510 --> 01:38:23,260
0-4.

1684
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:24,640
-07  -07
- 0-7. - 0-7.

1685
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,460
-喂喂  -1970
- Excuse me. - 1-9-7-0.

1686
01:38:27,060 --> 01:38:28,090
你确定吗
Are you sure?

1687
01:38:28,100 --> 01:38:29,690
美队  队长
Cap? Captain?

1688
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:31,650
史蒂夫  抱歉
Steve? Sorry.

1689
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:33,110
美国  罗杰斯
America. Rogers.

1690
01:38:33,110 --> 01:38:34,630
如果你们去了
Look, if you do this...

1691
01:38:34,900 --> 01:38:37,430
但不成功  你们就回不来了
and it doesn't work, you're not coming back.

1692
01:38:38,610 --> 01:38:40,180
谢谢你的鼓励  小透明
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant.

1693
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:42,390
你相信我吗
You trust me?

1694
01:38:43,410 --> 01:38:44,480
相信
I do.

1695
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:46,860
你决定
Your call.

1696
01:38:48,040 --> 01:38:48,980
走吧
Here we go.

1697
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:09,250
伙计  做爱  不作战
Hey, man! Make love, not war.

1698
01:39:15,480 --> 01:39:18,150
你显然不是真在这里出生的吧
Clearly you weren't actually born here, right?

1699
01:39:18,150 --> 01:39:19,600
是我的概念的诞生地
The idea of me was.

1700
01:39:20,410 --> 01:39:22,200
好吧  如果你是神盾局
Right. Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1701
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,890
运作一个准法西斯情报机构
running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization...

1702
01:39:27,040 --> 01:39:28,230
你会把它藏在哪
where do you hide it?

1703
01:39:28,660 --> 01:39:29,940
藏在眼皮下
In plain sight.

1704
01:39:58,860 --> 01:40:00,190
祝你任务顺利  队长
Good luck on your mission, Captain.

1705
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:02,600
祝你项目顺利  博士
Good luck on your project, Doctor.

1706
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:07,390
你新来的吗
You new here?

1707
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:11,230
并不是
Not exactly.

1708
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:19,700
快点
Come on, you bastard.

1709
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:27,540
找到了
Gotcha.

1710
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:46,640
又有戏了
Back in the game.

1711
01:40:50,040 --> 01:40:51,310
阿尼姆  是你吗
Arnim, you in there?

1712
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:52,730
阿尼姆
Arnim?

1713
01:41:00,130 --> 01:41:01,700
门在这边  伙计
The door is this way, pal.

1714
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,200
是啊
Oh, yeah.

1715
01:41:04,220 --> 01:41:05,930
找佐拉博士呢  看到他了吗
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him?

1716
01:41:05,930 --> 01:41:09,370
嗯  佐拉博士  我谁都没看见
Yeah, Doctor Zola. No, I haven't seen a soul.

1717
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:12,040
请原谅
Pardon me.

1718
01:41:13,180 --> 01:41:14,130
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

1719
01:41:16,230 --> 01:41:17,420
不  先生
No, sir. I'm...

1720
01:41:18,570 --> 01:41:20,010
我是麻省理工学院来参观的
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1721
01:41:20,690 --> 01:41:21,760
麻省理工学院
MIT.

1722
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:23,390
叫什么
Got a name?

1723
01:41:24,110 --> 01:41:24,970
霍华德
Howard.

1724
01:41:25,070 --> 01:41:27,470
-那我好记了  -霍华德
- That'll be easy to remember. - Howard...

1725
01:41:29,120 --> 01:41:30,140
波茨
Potts.

1726
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,980
我是霍华德·斯塔克
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1727
01:41:33,870 --> 01:41:34,830
握我  别拉
Shake that, don't pull it.

1728
01:41:33,890 --> 01:41:34,890
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}拉手指放屁

1729
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:35,940
嗯
Yeah.

1730
01:41:37,830 --> 01:41:40,130
你脸色不太好啊  波茨
You look a little green around the gills, there, Potts.

1731
01:41:40,130 --> 01:41:42,030
我没事  就是干活儿累了
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1732
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:43,780
想去呼吸下新鲜空气吗
You wanna get some air?

1733
01:41:46,680 --> 01:41:48,080
-喂  波茨  -好
- Hello, Potts. - Yeah.

1734
01:41:48,640 --> 01:41:49,850
-那太好了  -这边走
- That'd be swell. - That way.

1735
01:41:49,850 --> 01:41:50,750
好
Okay.

1736
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:52,460
要拿上你的箱子吗
Need your briefcase?

1737
01:41:57,190 --> 01:41:59,260
你不是那种垮掉的一代吧  波茨
You're not one of those beatniks, are you, Potts?

1738
01:42:05,610 --> 01:42:07,390
-喂  -皮姆博士
- Hello? - Doctor Pym?

1739
01:42:07,450 --> 01:42:10,030
你打的是这个号码  没错
That would be the number that you called, yes.

1740
01:42:10,030 --> 01:42:12,370
我是运输部的史蒂文斯上尉
This is Captain Stevens from shipping.

1741
01:42:12,370 --> 01:42:13,600
这里有个给你的包裹
We have a package for you.

1742
01:42:13,950 --> 01:42:15,000
拿上来吧
Bring it up.

1743
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,900
问题就在这里  先生  我们没法拿
That's the thing, sir, we can't.

1744
01:42:18,380 --> 01:42:20,740
我不懂  那不是你的工作吗
I'm confused. I thought that was your job.

1745
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,110
就是...
Well, it's just...

1746
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:23,670
先生  这盒子在发光
Sir, the box is glowing...

1747
01:42:23,670 --> 01:42:24,840
老实说
and to be honest,

1748
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:27,080
几个邮递员也不太舒服
some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great.

1749
01:42:27,130 --> 01:42:28,720
他们没打开它吧
They didn't open it, did they?

1750
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:30,870
他们开了  您最好赶紧来
Yeah, they did. You better get down here.

1751
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,660
借过  让开
Excuse me! Out of the way!

1752
01:43:01,170 --> 01:43:04,150
鲜花和德国泡菜  今晚有重要约会吗
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?

1753
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:06,860
我妻子要生了
My wife's expecting.

1754
01:43:07,090 --> 01:43:09,580
平时我又老泡办公室
And too much time at the office.

1755
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:12,890
恭喜
Congratulations.

1756
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:14,830
-谢谢  替我拿下  -好
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya? - Yeah, sure.

1757
01:43:16,470 --> 01:43:18,290
-她怀多久了  -不知道
- How far along is she? - I don't know.

1758
01:43:20,480 --> 01:43:21,270
反正她现在
She's at the point

1759
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:23,130
受不了我嚼东西的声音
where she can't stand the sound of my chewing.

1760
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:26,220
看来我又得去餐具室吃晚饭了
I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again.

1761
01:43:27,650 --> 01:43:28,720
我有个女儿
I have a little girl.

1762
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:30,100
是女儿就好了
A girl would be nice.

1763
01:43:30,360 --> 01:43:32,680
那样她比较不太可能变成我这样
Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me.

1764
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,580
那有什么不好的
What'd be so awful about that?

1765
01:43:34,580 --> 01:43:36,370
这么说吧  我很少能
Let's just say that the greater good

1766
01:43:36,370 --> 01:43:40,480
把大局放在自利之上
has rarely outweighed my own self-interest.

1767
01:43:44,040 --> 01:43:45,250
你从未见过这两人吗
And you've never seen these two men before?

1768
01:43:45,250 --> 01:43:47,550
没  我眼神很刁的  他俩看上去很可疑
No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.

1769
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:48,300
可以描述一下吗
Can you describe them?

1770
01:43:48,300 --> 01:43:50,050
其中一个留了嬉皮士胡子
One of them had a hippie beard.

1771
01:43:50,050 --> 01:43:51,590
嬉皮士  是比吉斯乐队还是蒙格·杰里那种
Hippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1772
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:52,840
绝对是蒙格·杰里
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1773
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:53,590
我是切斯特
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1774
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,680
所有可调动宪兵前往地下六层
I need every available MP to sublevel six.

1775
01:43:55,680 --> 01:43:57,170
可能有人闯入
We have a potential breach.

1776
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:15,950
我说了叫他们回来
I said bring them in.

1777
01:44:15,950 --> 01:44:17,120
他们在试了  长官
They're trying, ma'am,

1778
01:44:17,120 --> 01:44:18,790
但布拉多克的小队被雷击阻拦了
but Braddock's unit has been stopped by lightning strikes.

1779
01:44:18,790 --> 01:44:20,000
老天爷啊
Oh, for the love of...

1780
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,480
我会看看天气预报的
I'll look at the weather projections.

1781
01:44:45,610 --> 01:44:47,720
这可不是雷击
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.

1782
01:44:58,990 --> 01:45:00,700
名字想得怎么样了
So, where you at with names?

1783
01:45:00,700 --> 01:45:03,940
如果是男孩  我妻子想叫埃蒙泽
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.

1784
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:06,980
还是再考虑考虑吧  还有时间呢
Might wanna let that stew awhile. You got time.

1785
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:10,280
我问问你
Let me ask you a question.

1786
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:12,780
你孩子出生时
When your kid was born,

1787
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:14,880
你紧张吗
were you nervous?

1788
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:15,740
可紧张了
Wildly.

1789
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:18,300
-是啊  -你觉得自己够格吗
- Yeah. - Did you feel qualified?

1790
01:45:18,300 --> 01:45:20,180
你知道
Like you had any idea

1791
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:22,220
要怎么成功操作那玩意吗
how to successfully operate that thing?

1792
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:25,270
我真的是一边干一边学的
I literally pieced it together as I went along.

1793
01:45:25,270 --> 01:45:27,510
我回想了我爸爸是怎么做的
I thought about what my dad did.

1794
01:45:28,110 --> 01:45:30,930
我老爸  他什么问题都用皮带解决
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.

1795
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:33,030
我以前觉得我爸爸对我很严厉
I thought my dad was tough on me.

1796
01:45:33,030 --> 01:45:34,320
而如今回想起来
And now, looking back on it,

1797
01:45:34,320 --> 01:45:35,720
我只记得那些美好的回忆
I just remember the good stuff.

1798
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:37,770
他偶尔也说过些金句
You know? He did drop the odd pearl.

1799
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:39,310
是吗  比如呢
Yeah? Like what?

1800
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:42,810
"千金难买寸光阴"
"No amount of money ever bought a second of time."

1801
01:45:44,120 --> 01:45:45,310
他很睿智
Smart guy.

1802
01:45:45,710 --> 01:45:46,820
他尽力了
He did his best.

1803
01:45:48,380 --> 01:45:49,990
我跟你说  那孩子还没出生
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet

1804
01:45:50,380 --> 01:45:52,070
我已经愿意为他付出一切了
and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him.

1805
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,040
很高兴认识你  波茨
Good to meet you, Potts.

1806
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:04,290
我也是
Yeah.

1807
01:46:04,430 --> 01:46:05,380
霍华德
Howard...

1808
01:46:06,310 --> 01:46:07,750
一切都会没事的
everything's gonna be all right.

1809
01:46:10,730 --> 01:46:11,630
谢谢你
Thank you...

1810
01:46:13,150 --> 01:46:14,180
做的一切
for everything...

1811
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:16,470
为这个国家做的一切
you've done for this country.

1812
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:20,810
贾维斯
Jarvis.

1813
01:46:24,620 --> 01:46:25,900
我们见过那个人吗
Have we ever met that guy?

1814
01:46:28,330 --> 01:46:29,900
您每天会见到很多人  先生
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1815
01:46:32,380 --> 01:46:33,650
看着很眼熟
Seems very familiar.

1816
01:46:35,010 --> 01:46:36,160
胡子挺怪的
Weird beard.

1817
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:45,830
你好弱
You're weak.

1818
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,540
我就是你
I'm you.

1819
01:47:04,910 --> 01:47:06,520
你可以阻止这一切
You could stop this.

1820
01:47:07,330 --> 01:47:09,320
你知道你想的
You know you want to.

1821
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,190
你看到未来发生了什么吗
Did you see what happens in the future?

1822
01:47:13,340 --> 01:47:15,860
灭霸拿到了灵魂宝石
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1823
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:19,080
你想知道他是怎么拿到的吗
You wanna know how he does that?

1824
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:25,080
你想知道他对你做了什么吗
You wanna know what he does to you?

1825
01:47:25,390 --> 01:47:26,420
够了
That's enough.

1826
01:47:39,110 --> 01:47:40,720
你让我恶心
You disgust me.

1827
01:47:41,780 --> 01:47:46,270
但这不代表你毫无用处
But that doesn't mean you're useless.

1828
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:09,880
我看起来怎么样
How do I look?

1829
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:20,550
要不是在这种情况下
Under different circumstances...

1830
01:48:22,110 --> 01:48:23,850
这本会很赞的
this would be totally awesome.

1831
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:38,280
我敢说那浣熊不用爬山
I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain.

1832
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:41,130
严格说  他也不是浣熊
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know?

1833
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:42,870
随便  反正他吃垃圾
Whatever. He eats garbage.

1834
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:44,030
欢迎
Welcome.

1835
01:48:47,640 --> 01:48:48,660
娜塔莎
Natasha.

1836
01:48:49,100 --> 01:48:50,420
伊凡之女
Daughter of Ivan.

1837
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:52,380
克林特
Clint.

1838
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,340
伊迪丝之子
Son of Edith.

1839
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:01,510
你是谁
Who are you?

1840
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:04,560
就当我是向导
Consider me a guide...

1841
01:49:05,070 --> 01:49:06,100
指引你们
to you...

1842
01:49:06,450 --> 01:49:08,740
和所有人寻找灵魂宝石的人
and to all who seek the Soul Stone.

1843
01:49:08,740 --> 01:49:09,950
很好
Oh, good.

1844
01:49:09,950 --> 01:49:12,480
你告诉我们宝石在哪  我们马上就去
You tell us where it is, then we'll be on our way.

1845
01:49:13,410 --> 01:49:14,650
亲爱的
Liebling.

1846
01:49:16,040 --> 01:49:18,110
要是那么简单就好了
If only it were that easy.

1847
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:33,580
你所寻找的就在你面前
What you seek lies in front of you.

1848
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:37,550
你所害怕的也在那里
As does what you fear.

1849
01:49:42,860 --> 01:49:44,260
宝石就在下面
The stone's down there.

1850
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:46,510
只能给一个人
For one of you.

1851
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:48,890
而另一个
For the other...

1852
01:49:51,910 --> 01:49:53,870
要得到灵魂宝石
In order to take the stone...

1853
01:49:53,870 --> 01:49:56,480
你必须失去自己的珍爱之物
you must lose that which you love.

1854
01:49:58,330 --> 01:50:00,990
永恒的交换
An everlasting exchange.

1855
01:50:02,590 --> 01:50:05,990
以一个灵魂  换一个灵魂
A soul for a soul.

1856
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:10,250
你好啊
How's it going?

1857
01:50:13,930 --> 01:50:15,210
老天
Jesus.

1858
01:50:15,770 --> 01:50:17,800
这可能都是他编的
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1859
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:19,260
不
No.

1860
01:50:20,520 --> 01:50:21,670
我不这么认为
I don't think so.

1861
01:50:22,190 --> 01:50:23,970
为什么  就因为他知道你爸爸的名字吗
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name?

1862
01:50:26,030 --> 01:50:27,050
连我都不知道
I didn't.

1863
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:30,220
灭霸带着灵魂宝石离开了这里
Thanos left here with the stone...

1864
01:50:31,450 --> 01:50:33,100
却没带走他女儿
without his daughter.

1865
01:50:33,240 --> 01:50:34,940
那不是巧合
That's not a coincidence.

1866
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:37,360
的确
Yeah.

1867
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:41,280
不惜一切
Whatever it takes.

1868
01:50:46,170 --> 01:50:47,240
不惜一切
Whatever it takes.

1869
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:53,500
如果我们拿不到宝石
If we don't get that stone...

1870
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:55,670
几十亿人就不能复生
billions of people stay dead.

1871
01:50:56,640 --> 01:50:57,380
是啊
Yeah.

1872
01:50:59,770 --> 01:51:01,630
我想我们都知道该牺牲的是谁了
Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.

1873
01:51:02,570 --> 01:51:03,720
我想是的
I guess we do.

1874
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:13,480
我开始觉得
I'm starting to think

1875
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:16,480
我们想的不是一个人  娜塔莎
we mean different people here, Natasha.

1876
01:51:17,250 --> 01:51:19,370
过去五年来  我一直在为一件事努力
For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing.

1877
01:51:19,370 --> 01:51:20,480
就是此刻
Get to right here.

1878
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:22,670
一切都是为了此刻  让所有人复生
That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.

1879
01:51:22,670 --> 01:51:25,250
不  你别在这时候跟我装伟大
No, don't you get all decent on me now.

1880
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:26,820
怎么  你以为我想这么做吗
What, you think I wanna do it?

1881
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,670
我是在救你的命  傻瓜
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.

1882
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:31,830
可我不想让你救  行吗
Yeah, well, I don't want you to. How's that?

1883
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:34,870
娜塔莎  你知道我都做了什么
Natasha, you know what I've done.

1884
01:51:36,930 --> 01:51:38,420
你知道我已变成了什么样的人
You know what I've become.

1885
01:51:40,730 --> 01:51:43,380
我不会以一个人最糟糕的错误来评判他
I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.

1886
01:51:47,610 --> 01:51:48,720
或许你应该这样
Maybe you should.

1887
01:51:49,860 --> 01:51:50,800
你当年就没有
You didn't.

1888
01:51:57,540 --> 01:51:59,230
你真是太烦人了  你知道吗
You're a pain in my ass, you know that?

1889
01:52:10,680 --> 01:52:11,490
好
Okay.

1890
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,700
你赢了
You win.

1891
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:23,000
跟我家人说我爱他们
Tell my family I love 'em.

1892
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:27,630
你自己告诉他们
You tell 'em yourself.

1893
01:53:01,020 --> 01:53:01,920
该死的
Damn you.

1894
01:53:09,150 --> 01:53:09,970
等等
Wait.

1895
01:53:18,240 --> 01:53:19,310
放手吧
Let me go.

1896
01:53:21,250 --> 01:53:22,150
不
No.

1897
01:53:24,210 --> 01:53:25,230
不要啊
No. Please, no.

1898
01:53:28,380 --> 01:53:29,570
没事的
It's okay.

1899
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:33,450
别
Please.

1900
01:53:35,260 --> 01:53:36,160
不要
No!

1901
01:55:17,990 --> 01:55:19,100
我们都拿到了吗
Did we get 'em all?

1902
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:22,060
你是说真成功了吗
Are you telling me this actually worked?

1903
01:55:26,910 --> 01:55:28,110
克林特  小娜呢
Clint, where's Nat?

1904
01:55:57,490 --> 01:55:58,930
她有家人吗
Do we know if she had family?

1905
01:55:59,490 --> 01:56:00,300
有
Yeah.

1906
01:56:00,820 --> 01:56:01,850
我们
Us.

1907
01:56:03,320 --> 01:56:04,020
什么
What?

1908
01:56:06,160 --> 01:56:07,580
-你干什么  -就是问他个问题
- What are you doing? - Just asked him a question.

1909
01:56:07,580 --> 01:56:08,950
不  你一副她已经死了的样子
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead.

1910
01:56:08,950 --> 01:56:10,040
我们为什么一副她已经死了的样子
Why are we acting like she's dead?

1911
01:56:10,040 --> 01:56:11,480
我们有宝石啊
We have the stones, right?

1912
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:13,210
只要我们有宝石  队长
As long as we have the stones, Cap,

1913
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:14,330
我们能复活她的  是吧
we can bring her back. Isn't that right?

1914
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:16,840
别垂头丧气的了  我们是复仇者  振作起来
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers. Get it together.

1915
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:18,070
不能复活她
Can't get her back.

1916
01:56:21,010 --> 01:56:22,470
他说什么...什么
What's he...? What?

1917
01:56:22,470 --> 01:56:23,790
不能撤销
It can't be undone.

1918
01:56:24,430 --> 01:56:25,290
不能
It can't.

1919
01:56:28,140 --> 01:56:29,890
对不起  别介意
Look, I'm sorry, no offense, but

1920
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:31,680
但你就是个地球人  好吗
you're a very earthly being, okay?

1921
01:56:31,690 --> 01:56:33,270
这可是太空魔法
And we're talking about space magic.

1922
01:56:33,270 --> 01:56:35,280
"不能"也太绝对了  不是吗
And "can't" seems very definitive. Don't you think?

1923
01:56:35,280 --> 01:56:38,320
我知道这远超我的水平
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my pay grade here.

1924
01:56:38,320 --> 01:56:39,970
但她还是不在  是吧
But she still isn't here, is she?

1925
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:41,190
我就是这意思
No, that's my point.

1926
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:43,850
是不能撤销的
It can't be undone.

1927
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:45,240
至少
Or that's at least

1928
01:56:45,240 --> 01:56:47,700
那个飘着的红人是这么说的
what the red, floating guy had to say.

1929
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:49,370
或许你该去跟他谈谈
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay?

1930
01:56:49,370 --> 01:56:52,770
你去拿上锤子  飞过去  跟他谈谈
Go grab your hammer and you go fly and you talk to him.

1931
01:57:00,840 --> 01:57:02,240
本该是我的
It was supposed to be me.

1932
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:07,760
她为了那颗宝石牺牲了生命
She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone.

1933
01:57:07,760 --> 01:57:09,250
她赌上了性命
She bet her life on it.

1934
01:57:14,230 --> 01:57:15,840
她回不来了
She's not coming back.

1935
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:20,090
我们不能让她白死
We have to make it worth it.

1936
01:57:20,400 --> 01:57:21,470
绝对不能
We have to.

1937
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:24,180
不会的
We will.

1938
01:57:56,310 --> 01:57:57,800
好  手套准备好了
All right, the glove's ready.

1939
01:57:58,730 --> 01:58:01,340
问题是  谁来打指响
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers?

1940
01:58:01,820 --> 01:58:02,760
我来
I'll do it.

1941
01:58:03,190 --> 01:58:04,030
-什么  -没事
- Excuse me? - It's okay.

1942
01:58:04,030 --> 01:58:05,680
-不不  -打住  别急
- No, no, no. - Stop, stop. Slow down.

1943
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:07,160
托尔  等等
Thor. Just wait.

1944
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:09,220
我们还没决定由谁来戴
We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet.

1945
01:58:09,780 --> 01:58:11,370
不好意思  难道我们还要干坐着
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting around

1946
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:12,830
等待合适时机吗
waiting for the right opportunity?

1947
01:58:12,830 --> 01:58:14,120
我们至少该谈谈
We should at least discuss it.

1948
01:58:14,120 --> 01:58:15,960
坐在这里盯着它看
Look, sitting here staring at the thing

1949
01:58:15,960 --> 01:58:17,820
是不会让大家复活的
is not gonna bring everybody back.

1950
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:20,380
我是最强的复仇者  好吗
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay?

1951
01:58:20,380 --> 01:58:22,130
所以这责任该由我来担
So, this responsibility falls upon me.

1952
01:58:22,130 --> 01:58:23,340
-一般来说  你是对的  -这是我的责任
- Normally, you're right. - It's my duty.

1953
01:58:23,340 --> 01:58:24,420
-但那不是重点  -不是那个
- It's not about that. - It's not that.

1954
01:58:24,420 --> 01:58:27,160
-伙计  -住口  让我来吧
- Hey, buddy... - Stop it! Just let me.

1955
01:58:30,220 --> 01:58:31,620
让我来吧
Just let me do it.

1956
01:58:32,010 --> 01:58:33,970
让我做件好事  做件对的事
Just let me do something good. Something right.

1957
01:58:33,970 --> 01:58:35,520
这不光是因为
Look, it's not just the fact that

1958
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,190
那只手套所承载的能量
that glove is channeling enough energy

1959
01:58:37,190 --> 01:58:38,100
足以点亮一个大陆
to light up a continent.

1960
01:58:38,100 --> 01:58:40,230
相信我  你的状态不行
I'm telling you. You're in no condition.

1961
01:58:40,230 --> 01:58:43,570
你以为我现在血管里流的是什么
What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?

1962
01:58:43,570 --> 01:58:44,630
奶酪吗
Cheez Whiz?

1963
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:48,030
雷电
Lightning.

1964
01:58:48,030 --> 01:58:49,360
-是啊  -雷电
- Yeah. - Lightning.

1965
01:58:49,370 --> 01:58:51,060
雷电也帮不了你  伙计
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1966
01:58:51,120 --> 01:58:52,430
得由我来
It's gotta be me.

1967
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:56,520
你们看到宝石对灭霸的伤害了
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.

1968
01:58:56,580 --> 01:58:57,860
他差点没命
They almost killed him.

1969
01:58:59,580 --> 01:59:01,610
你们都撑不住的
None of you could survive.

1970
01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:03,490
我们怎么知道你撑得住
How do we know you will?

1971
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:05,030
我们不知道
We don't.

1972
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:07,620
但辐射主要就是伽马射线
But the radiation's mostly gamma.

1973
01:59:11,260 --> 01:59:12,660
就好像
It's like...

1974
01:59:14,850 --> 01:59:16,460
我是为此而诞生的
I was made for this.

1975
01:59:35,700 --> 01:59:37,060
可以了吗
Good to go, yeah?

1976
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:40,270
开始吧
Let's do it.

1977
01:59:40,710 --> 01:59:41,620
好  记住
Okay, remember,

1978
01:59:41,630 --> 01:59:43,420
五年前被灭霸的指响打没的人
everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago

1979
01:59:43,420 --> 01:59:45,820
你把他们带回来  回到现在  今天来
you're just bringing them back to now, today.

1980
01:59:46,210 --> 01:59:48,240
别改变过去五年里的任何事
Don't change anything from the last five years.

1981
01:59:48,920 --> 01:59:49,950
好的
Got it.

1982
02:00:06,860 --> 02:00:07,730
星期五  帮个忙
Friday, do me a favor

1983
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:09,530
启动谷仓门协议  好吗
and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya?

1984
02:00:09,530 --> 02:00:10,550
是  老板
Yes, boss.

1985
02:00:19,620 --> 02:00:20,980
大家回家吧
Everybody comes home.

1986
02:00:44,650 --> 02:00:46,100
摘掉
Take it off! Take it off!

1987
02:00:46,100 --> 02:00:47,760
不  等等  布鲁斯  你没事吧
No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

1988
02:00:48,530 --> 02:00:49,680
说话  班纳
Talk to me, Banner.

1989
02:00:53,200 --> 02:00:54,220
我没事
I'm okay.

1990
02:00:54,570 --> 02:00:55,430
我没事
I'm okay.

1991
02:01:27,190 --> 02:01:27,960
布鲁斯
Bruce!

1992
02:01:29,980 --> 02:01:30,930
别碰他
Don't move him.

1993
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:41,100
-成功了吗  -我们不确定  没事的
- Did it work? - We're not sure. It's okay.

1994
02:02:27,120 --> 02:02:27,940
亲爱的
Honey.

1995
02:02:28,040 --> 02:02:28,860
克林特
Clint?

1996
02:02:29,170 --> 02:02:29,990
亲爱的
Honey.

1997
02:02:31,420 --> 02:02:32,280
各位
Guys...

1998
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:36,780
好像成功了
I think it worked.

1999
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:21,040
我无法呼吸了
I can't breathe! I can't breathe!

2000
02:03:22,300 --> 02:03:24,160
脱罩
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

2001
02:03:30,810 --> 02:03:32,670
罗德  火箭  快出去
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here.

2002
02:03:33,610 --> 02:03:35,300
放我出去
Let me up! Let me up!

2003
02:03:35,690 --> 02:03:36,720
快点
Come on!

2004
02:03:46,910 --> 02:03:47,940
罗德
Rhodey!

2005
02:03:56,210 --> 02:03:57,960
求救  有人收到吗
Mayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy?

2006
02:03:57,970 --> 02:03:59,340
我们在下层  淹水了
We're on the lower level. It's flooding!

2007
02:03:59,340 --> 02:04:00,990
什么
What? What?

2008
02:04:01,050 --> 02:04:03,510
我们要淹死了  有人收到吗  求救
We are drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

2009
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:05,750
等等  我在
Wait! I'm here!

2010
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:07,540
我在  收到了吗
I'm here. Can you hear me?

2011
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:28,190
队长
Cap?

2012
02:04:54,600 --> 02:04:55,630
好吧
Okay.

2013
02:05:12,870 --> 02:05:13,820
女儿
Daughter.

2014
02:05:14,120 --> 02:05:15,190
是  父亲
Yes, Father.

2015
02:05:17,210 --> 02:05:19,110
这就是未来
So, this is the future.

2016
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:20,610
好样的
Well done.

2017
02:05:21,210 --> 02:05:22,530
谢谢  父亲
Thank you, Father.

2018
02:05:22,760 --> 02:05:24,370
他们毫未怀疑
They suspected nothing.

2019
02:05:26,600 --> 02:05:28,200
自大者总是如此
The arrogant never do.

2020
02:05:31,020 --> 02:05:31,830
去
Go.

2021
02:05:33,060 --> 02:05:35,550
找到宝石  拿给我
Find the stones, bring them to me.

2022
02:05:35,690 --> 02:05:37,010
你要做什么
What will you do?

2023
02:05:38,730 --> 02:05:39,920
等着
Wait.

2024
02:06:05,720 --> 02:06:06,950
告诉我
Tell me something.

2025
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:09,700
在未来
In the future...

2026
02:06:11,100 --> 02:06:12,710
你和我怎么样了
what happens to you and me?

2027
02:06:15,140 --> 02:06:16,540
我企图杀你
I try to kill you.

2028
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:19,920
好几次
Several times.

2029
02:06:21,150 --> 02:06:22,300
但最终
But eventually...

2030
02:06:23,240 --> 02:06:24,470
我们成了朋友
we become friends.

2031
02:06:26,740 --> 02:06:28,220
我们成了姐妹
We become sisters.

2032
02:06:36,040 --> 02:06:36,980
来吧
Come on.

2033
02:06:39,250 --> 02:06:40,490
我们可以阻止他
We can stop him.

2034
02:06:49,340 --> 02:06:50,410
拜托  伙计  醒醒
Come on, buddy, wake up!

2035
02:06:51,010 --> 02:06:52,080
这就对了
That's my man.

2036
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:55,920
你再弄丢  我可就不还你了
You lose this again, I'm keeping it.

2037
02:06:58,980 --> 02:07:00,090
怎么回事
What happened?

2038
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:02,420
你扰乱时间  时间就给你捣乱
You mess with time, it tends to mess back.

2039
02:07:02,610 --> 02:07:03,590
你会明白的
You'll see.

2040
02:07:25,670 --> 02:07:26,740
他都干什么了
What's he been doing?

2041
02:07:28,800 --> 02:07:30,200
什么都没干
Absolutely nothing.

2042
02:07:32,050 --> 02:07:33,580
宝石呢
Where are the stones?

2043
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:35,870
在这堆东西下面
Somewhere under all this.

2044
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,130
我只知道他没拿到
All I know is he doesn't have 'em.

2045
02:07:39,980 --> 02:07:41,480
那就别让他拿到
So, we keep it that way.

2046
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:43,210
你们知道这是陷阱吧
You know it's a trap, right?

2047
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:44,340
知道
Yeah.

2048
02:07:44,730 --> 02:07:46,010
我不怎么在乎
I don't much care.

2049
02:07:46,990 --> 02:07:47,760
很好
Good.

2050
02:07:48,990 --> 02:07:51,510
只要我们都达成一致就行
Just as long as we're all in agreement.

2051
02:08:01,370 --> 02:08:03,190
我们这次要好好杀了他
Let's kill him properly this time.

2052
02:08:12,590 --> 02:08:15,200
你们无法承受自己的失败
You could not live with your own failure.

2053
02:08:17,060 --> 02:08:18,420
结果如何呢
Where did that bring you?

2054
02:08:21,810 --> 02:08:22,840
又跟我碰面了
Back to me.

2055
02:08:27,150 --> 02:08:29,800
我本以为抹除了一半的生命
I thought by eliminating half of life...

2056
02:08:30,530 --> 02:08:32,680
另一半就能兴旺
the other half would thrive.

2057
02:08:33,370 --> 02:08:34,810
但你们让我知道
But you've shown me...

2058
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:37,350
那是不可能的
that's impossible.

2059
02:08:39,450 --> 02:08:42,690
只要还有人记得曾经
And as long as there are those that remember what was...

2060
02:08:42,790 --> 02:08:44,290
就总会有人
there will always be those

2061
02:08:44,290 --> 02:08:47,900
无法接受可能的未来
that are unable to accept what can be.

2062
02:08:48,920 --> 02:08:50,280
他们会抵抗
They will resist.

2063
02:08:50,550 --> 02:08:52,450
对  我们就那么固执
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn.

2064
02:08:53,430 --> 02:08:54,700
我很感激
I'm thankful.

2065
02:08:57,100 --> 02:08:58,460
因为现在
Because now...

2066
02:08:59,180 --> 02:09:00,880
我知道我该怎么办了
I know what I must do.

2067
02:09:01,770 --> 02:09:06,800
我要粉碎全宇宙  化为原子
I will shred this universe down to its last atom.

2068
02:09:07,860 --> 02:09:08,970
然后
And then...

2069
02:09:09,610 --> 02:09:12,100
再用你们替我收集的宝石
with the stones you've collected for me...

2070
02:09:12,700 --> 02:09:14,140
创造个新宇宙
create a new one...

2071
02:09:15,160 --> 02:09:16,640
充满生机
teeming with life...

2072
02:09:17,330 --> 02:09:19,160
它不会知道自己失去了什么
that knows not what it has lost...

2073
02:09:19,160 --> 02:09:21,270
只知道它被赋予了什么
but only what it has been given.

2074
02:09:24,830 --> 02:09:26,610
一个感恩的宇宙
A grateful universe.

2075
02:09:26,840 --> 02:09:28,290
从鲜血中诞生
Born out of blood.

2076
02:09:28,300 --> 02:09:29,700
他们不会知道的
They'll never know it.

2077
02:09:31,010 --> 02:09:33,490
因为你们活不到那时告诉他们
Because you won't be alive to tell them.

2078
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:50,430
另一边见了  伙计
See you on the other side, man.

2079
02:09:52,490 --> 02:09:54,350
撑着  我来了
Hang on! I'm coming!

2080
02:10:24,670 --> 02:10:25,560
好啊
Yeah!

2081
02:10:42,150 --> 02:10:43,120
我认识你
I know you.

2082
02:10:46,920 --> 02:10:47,800
父亲
Father...

2083
02:10:48,650 --> 02:10:49,880
我拿到宝石了
I have the stones.

2084
02:10:50,090 --> 02:10:50,940
什么
What?

2085
02:10:52,480 --> 02:10:53,420
住手
Stop.

2086
02:10:58,670 --> 02:10:59,920
你要背叛我们
You're betraying us?

2087
02:11:06,060 --> 02:11:07,430
你不用这么做的
You don't have to do this.

2088
02:11:10,090 --> 02:11:12,750
我就是这样
I am this.

2089
02:11:12,850 --> 02:11:14,700
不  你不是
No, you're not.

2090
02:11:15,220 --> 02:11:16,610
你看到我们变成什么样了
You've seen what we become.

2091
02:11:23,140 --> 02:11:24,630
星云  听她的
Nebula, listen to her.

2092
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:28,020
你可以改变的
You can change.

2093
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:35,580
他不会允许的
He won't let me.

2094
02:11:37,630 --> 02:11:38,570
不要
No!

2095
02:11:57,850 --> 02:11:59,590
好  托尔  来吧
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2096
02:12:15,950 --> 02:12:17,070
老板  醒醒
Boss, wake up!

2097
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:09,550
我就知道
I knew it!

2098
02:14:32,450 --> 02:14:34,450
我南征北战这么多年
In all my years of conquest...

2099
02:14:36,290 --> 02:14:37,320
暴力
violence...

2100
02:14:39,160 --> 02:14:40,190
屠戮
slaughter...

2101
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:43,540
从来不是出于私怨
it was never personal.

2102
02:14:47,360 --> 02:14:48,620
但告诉你们
But I'll tell you now...

2103
02:14:51,440 --> 02:14:54,030
我马上要对你们顽固讨厌的
what I'm about to do to your stubborn,

2104
02:14:54,940 --> 02:14:56,680
小星球做的事
annoying little planet...

2105
02:14:59,380 --> 02:15:00,510
我会非常
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2106
02:15:02,380 --> 02:15:03,750
享受其中的
very, very much.

2107
02:16:08,220 --> 02:16:09,580
队长  收到吗
Hey, Cap, you read me?

2108
02:16:15,830 --> 02:16:17,480
队长  我是山姆  收到吗
Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?

2109
02:16:22,170 --> 02:16:23,210
在你左边
On your left.

2110
02:17:49,260 --> 02:17:50,300
就这些人了吗
Is that everyone?

2111
02:17:50,760 --> 02:17:52,040
什么  你还嫌不够吗
What? You wanted more?

2112
02:18:19,430 --> 02:18:20,660
复仇者
Avengers...

2113
02:18:26,360 --> 02:18:27,310
集结
assemble.

2114
02:19:02,640 --> 02:19:03,720
死吧
Die!

2115
02:19:24,740 --> 02:19:25,820
不  那个给我
No, no, give me that.

2116
02:19:25,940 --> 02:19:27,040
你拿那个小的
You have the little one.

2117
02:19:43,110 --> 02:19:44,090
我去
Holy cow!

2118
02:19:44,090 --> 02:19:45,340
你不会相信都发生了什么的
You will not believe what's been going on.

2119
02:19:45,340 --> 02:19:46,980
还记得我们在太空里时吗
Do you remember when we were in space?

2120
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:48,370
我化成灰了
And I got all dusty?

2121
02:19:48,370 --> 02:19:49,380
我肯定是昏了过去
And I must've passed out,

2122
02:19:49,380 --> 02:19:50,960
因为我醒来时  你不在了
because I woke up and you were gone.

2123
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:52,950
但斯特兰奇博士在  他说
But Doctor Strange was there, right? And he was like...

2124
02:19:52,950 --> 02:19:54,540
"已经过去五年了  快走  他们需要我们"
"It's been five years. Come on, they need us."

2125
02:19:54,540 --> 02:19:56,240
然后他就开始画那个亮亮的黄圈
And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing

2126
02:19:56,240 --> 02:19:57,500
-就他老做的那个  -是吗
- that he does all the time. - He did? Oh, no.

2127
02:19:57,500 --> 02:19:58,440
你干什么
What are you doing?

2128
02:20:03,940 --> 02:20:04,950
感觉好棒
Oh, this is nice.

2129
02:20:27,440 --> 02:20:28,340
卡魔拉
Gamora?

2130
02:20:37,730 --> 02:20:38,830
我以为我失去了你
I thought I lost you.

2131
02:20:43,920 --> 02:20:46,380
别  碰  我
Don't touch me!

2132
02:20:49,850 --> 02:20:51,150
你第一次没打中
You missed the first time.

2133
02:20:51,900 --> 02:20:53,970
然后第二次你一下踢中了俩
Then you got 'em both the second time.

2134
02:20:55,980 --> 02:20:56,960
就是他吗
This is the one?

2135
02:20:57,040 --> 02:20:58,080
不是吧
Seriously?

2136
02:20:58,350 --> 02:21:00,570
你只能在他和一棵树之间选择
Your choices were him or a tree.

2137
02:21:11,240 --> 02:21:12,110
队长
Cap!

2138
02:21:12,280 --> 02:21:13,910
你要我怎么处理这玩意啊
What do you want me to do with this damn thing?

2139
02:21:16,740 --> 02:21:18,730
把那些宝石拿得越远越好
Get those stones as far away as possible!

2140
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:19,810
不
No!

2141
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:23,300
我们还得把它们送回原处
We need to get 'em back where they came from.

2142
02:21:23,300 --> 02:21:24,090
没法送回去了
No way to get 'em back.

2143
02:21:24,090 --> 02:21:25,730
灭霸毁了量子隧道
Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.

2144
02:21:25,950 --> 02:21:26,870
等等
Hold on!

2145
02:21:28,700 --> 02:21:30,400
那不是唯一的时间机器
That wasn't our only time machine.

2146
02:21:36,850 --> 02:21:38,920
有人看到一辆丑爆了的棕色货车了吗
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there?

2147
02:21:39,290 --> 02:21:40,190
看到了
Yes!

2148
02:21:40,300 --> 02:21:42,190
但你不会喜欢它停车的地方的
But you're not gonna like where it's parked!

2149
02:21:42,320 --> 02:21:44,790
斯科特  你启动它需要多久
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?

2150
02:21:46,040 --> 02:21:47,060
大概10分钟
Maybe 10 minutes.

2151
02:21:47,060 --> 02:21:48,860
去启动机器  我们把宝石送去给你
Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.

2152
02:21:48,900 --> 02:21:49,910
好的  队长
We're on it, Cap.

2153
02:22:01,580 --> 02:22:03,670
你说是一千四百万之一的概率能赢  是吧
You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah?

2154
02:22:05,590 --> 02:22:06,650
就是这次吧
Tell me this is it.

2155
02:22:06,980 --> 02:22:08,360
如果我告诉你会发生什么
If I tell you what happens...

2156
02:22:09,050 --> 02:22:10,090
就不会发生了
it won't happen.

2157
02:22:13,930 --> 02:22:14,900
你最好是对的
You better be right.

2158
02:22:23,250 --> 02:22:24,570
后面好乱
It's a mess back here.

2159
02:22:25,990 --> 02:22:26,990
没反应
It's dead.

2160
02:22:27,630 --> 02:22:28,890
-什么  -没反应
- What? - It's dead.

2161
02:22:29,470 --> 02:22:30,670
我得热启动试试
I have to hot-wire it.

2162
02:22:33,870 --> 02:22:34,950
星云呢
Where's Nebula?

2163
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:37,500
她没回应
She's not responding.

2164
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:38,930
大人
Sire...

2165
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:49,870
克林特
Clint!

2166
02:22:52,430 --> 02:22:53,500
给我
Give it to me.

2167
02:23:15,740 --> 02:23:19,030
你夺走了我的一切
You took everything from me.

2168
02:23:19,440 --> 02:23:21,340
我都不知道你是谁
I don't even know who you are.

2169
02:23:22,070 --> 02:23:23,040
你会知道的
You will.

2170
02:23:45,870 --> 02:23:46,840
交给我
I got it!

2171
02:23:49,620 --> 02:23:51,090
启动击杀功能
Activate Instant Kill.

2172
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:15,540
全力轰炸
Rain fire!

2173
02:24:16,160 --> 02:24:18,180
但大人  我们的部队
But, sire, our troops!

2174
02:24:18,200 --> 02:24:19,620
照办
Just do it!

2175
02:24:40,850 --> 02:24:42,210
有人看到了吗
Is anyone else seeing this?

2176
02:24:56,430 --> 02:24:57,390
我行的
I got this!

2177
02:24:57,680 --> 02:24:58,610
我行的
I got this.

2178
02:24:58,610 --> 02:24:59,810
好吧  我不行了
Okay, I don't got this.

2179
02:24:59,950 --> 02:25:01,170
救命  谁救救我
Help, somebody help!

2180
02:25:01,170 --> 02:25:03,180
皇后区  看上面
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2181
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:14,660
抓住  有我呢  孩子
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2182
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:19,080
认识你很高兴
Nice to meet you...

2183
02:25:19,080 --> 02:25:20,400
老天爷啊
Oh, my God!

2184
02:25:57,480 --> 02:25:58,630
怎么回事
What the hell is this?

2185
02:25:59,570 --> 02:26:00,640
星期五  他们在冲什么开火
Friday, what are they firing at?

2186
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:02,690
有什么刚进入了上层大气
Something just entered the upper atmosphere.

2187
02:26:16,780 --> 02:26:17,890
好样的
Oh, yeah!

2188
02:26:38,110 --> 02:26:40,490
丹弗斯  我们这里需要帮助
Danvers, we need an assist here.

2189
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:51,710
我是彼得·帕克
I'm Peter Parker.

2190
02:26:52,420 --> 02:26:53,580
彼得·帕克
Hey, Peter Parker.

2191
02:26:53,980 --> 02:26:55,150
你有什么要给我吗
You got something for me?

2192
02:27:01,370 --> 02:27:03,170
我不知道你要怎么通过那一关
I don't know how you're gonna get it through all of that.

2193
02:27:04,990 --> 02:27:06,000
别担心
Don't worry.

2194
02:27:07,290 --> 02:27:08,480
她不是一个人
She's got help.

2195
02:29:56,730 --> 02:29:59,440
我是宿命
I am inevitable.

2196
02:30:20,450 --> 02:30:21,680
我
And I...

2197
02:30:23,610 --> 02:30:24,560
是
am...

2198
02:30:28,500 --> 02:30:29,540
钢铁侠
Iron Man.

2199
02:32:28,740 --> 02:32:29,610
斯塔克先生
Mr. Stark?

2200
02:32:33,070 --> 02:32:35,100
斯塔克先生  你能听到我吗
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me?

2201
02:32:36,250 --> 02:32:37,210
我是彼得
It's Peter.

2202
02:32:41,680 --> 02:32:44,010
我们赢了  斯塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

2203
02:32:46,510 --> 02:32:47,820
我们赢了  斯塔克先生
We won, Mr. Stark.

2204
02:32:50,460 --> 02:32:52,280
我们赢了  你做到了  先生  你做到了
We won! You did it, sir, you did it.

2205
02:32:54,260 --> 02:32:55,260
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

2206
02:32:55,540 --> 02:32:56,460
托尼
Tony.

2207
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:12,430
小派
Hey, Pep.

2208
02:33:17,520 --> 02:33:18,460
星期五
Friday?

2209
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:20,460
生命机能情况危急
Life functions critical.

2210
02:33:30,160 --> 02:33:31,050
托尼
Tony?

2211
02:33:32,520 --> 02:33:33,480
看着我
Look at me.

2212
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:37,380
我们会没事的
We're gonna be okay.

2213
02:33:42,790 --> 02:33:43,930
你可以休息了
You can rest now.

2214
02:35:30,110 --> 02:35:32,450
大家都想要一个快乐的结局  对吗
Everybody wants a happy ending, right?

2215
02:35:33,150 --> 02:35:34,910
但世事难料
But it doesn't always roll that way.

2216
02:35:37,460 --> 02:35:38,550
也许这次的结局会是快乐的
Maybe this time.

2217
02:35:40,610 --> 02:35:42,800
我希望你们回放这个的时候
I'm hoping if you play this back...

2218
02:35:44,970 --> 02:35:46,270
是在庆祝
it's in celebration.

2219
02:35:47,550 --> 02:35:51,460
我希望家人能够团圆  我希望我们能挽回
I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back.

2220
02:35:51,460 --> 02:35:52,810
这个星球能够回归
And something like a normal version

2221
02:35:52,810 --> 02:35:54,390
还算正常的版本
of the planet has been restored.

2222
02:35:55,330 --> 02:35:57,410
如果真有这种东西的话
If there ever was such a thing.

2223
02:35:58,050 --> 02:36:01,040
天呐  世界真奇妙  宇宙真奇妙
God, what a world. Universe, now.

2224
02:36:01,970 --> 02:36:04,050
如果你十年前跟我说我们并不孤单
If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone...

2225
02:36:04,060 --> 02:36:06,340
而且还热闹到这种程度
let alone to this extent, I mean,

2226
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:07,780
我倒不会觉得惊讶
I wouldn't have been surprised...

2227
02:36:07,780 --> 02:36:09,290
但谁能想到呢
but come on, who knew?

2228
02:36:09,770 --> 02:36:12,700
轮番登场的史诗般的
The epic forces of darkness and light

2229
02:36:12,700 --> 02:36:13,960
黑暗和光明势力
that have come into play.

2230
02:36:14,590 --> 02:36:16,060
不管是好是坏
And for better or worse...

2231
02:36:16,470 --> 02:36:18,070
这就是将伴随摩根
that's the reality Morgan's gonna

2232
02:36:18,070 --> 02:36:19,720
成长的现实
have to find a way to grow up in.

2233
02:36:24,030 --> 02:36:26,390
所以  我觉得最好录下一段问候
So, I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting,

2234
02:36:26,420 --> 02:36:29,530
以防我英年早逝了
in the case of an untimely death. On my part.

2235
02:36:30,050 --> 02:36:32,710
虽然死亡总是来得太早
Not that death at any time isn't untimely.

2236
02:36:34,050 --> 02:36:36,410
我们明天要尝试的时间旅行
This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow

2237
02:36:36,410 --> 02:36:39,900
真的很难说我们能不能活下来
it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all.

2238
02:36:39,900 --> 02:36:40,950
就是这样
That's the thing.

2239
02:36:43,190 --> 02:36:45,140
但是  做英雄就是如此  不是吗
Then again, that's the hero gig, right?

2240
02:36:45,140 --> 02:36:46,530
结束也是旅程的一部分
Part of the journey is the end.

2241
02:36:48,210 --> 02:36:49,280
我在耍什么疯
What am I even tripping for?

2242
02:36:49,290 --> 02:36:50,370
一切都会
Everything is gonna work out

2243
02:36:50,370 --> 02:36:53,410
如愿以偿的
exactly the way it's supposed to.

2244
02:36:57,110 --> 02:36:58,450
我爱你三千
I love you 3,000.

2245
02:39:13,590 --> 02:39:15,010
我希望有什么办法
You know, I wish there was a way

2246
02:39:16,070 --> 02:39:17,300
能让她知道
that I could let her know.

2247
02:39:19,970 --> 02:39:20,950
我们胜利了
That we won.

2248
02:39:23,380 --> 02:39:24,330
我们做到了
We did it.

2249
02:39:28,800 --> 02:39:29,760
她知道的
She knows.

2250
02:39:35,530 --> 02:39:36,670
他们俩都知道
They both do.

2251
02:39:46,470 --> 02:39:47,600
你好吗  小姑娘
How you doing, squirt?

2252
02:39:48,040 --> 02:39:48,780
我很好
Good.

2253
02:39:48,780 --> 02:39:49,740
好吗
You good?

2254
02:39:50,180 --> 02:39:51,610
好  你饿了吗
Good. You hungry?

2255
02:39:53,490 --> 02:39:54,390
你想吃什么
What do you want?

2256
02:39:55,190 --> 02:39:56,270
奶酪汉堡
Cheeseburgers.

2257
02:40:01,380 --> 02:40:02,950
你爸爸也喜欢奶酪汉堡
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2258
02:40:03,890 --> 02:40:04,900
好啊
Okay.

2259
02:40:07,910 --> 02:40:09,530
你想吃多少奶酪汉堡我都给你买
I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.

2260
02:40:10,250 --> 02:40:11,130
好
Okay.

2261
02:40:28,050 --> 02:40:29,000
那么...
So...

2262
02:40:29,760 --> 02:40:31,170
你什么时候回来
when can we expect you back?

2263
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:35,240
这事嘛...
About that...

2264
02:40:35,640 --> 02:40:38,010
托尔  你的人民需要一个王
Thor, your people need a king.

2265
02:40:38,010 --> 02:40:39,630
不  他们已经有王了
No, they already have one.

2266
02:40:42,250 --> 02:40:43,230
真好笑
That's funny.

2267
02:40:48,600 --> 02:40:49,750
你是认真的吗
Are you being serious?

2268
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,010
我该成为真正的自己
It's time for me to be who I am rather than

2269
02:40:57,000 --> 02:40:58,430
而不是去实现他人的期待
who I'm supposed to be.

2270
02:41:00,650 --> 02:41:02,370
但你  你是一个领袖
But you, you're a leader.

2271
02:41:03,120 --> 02:41:04,110
那就是真实的你
That's who you are.

2272
02:41:07,220 --> 02:41:09,210
我会在这里做出很多改变的
You know, I'd make a lot of changes around here.

2273
02:41:09,350 --> 02:41:10,660
我就指望你了
I'm counting on it...

2274
02:41:11,180 --> 02:41:12,290
女王陛下
Your Majesty.

2275
02:41:22,660 --> 02:41:23,890
那你要做什么
What will you do?

2276
02:41:24,600 --> 02:41:25,600
我不确定
I'm not sure.

2277
02:41:26,210 --> 02:41:28,230
千年以来  我第一次
For the first time in a thousand years,

2278
02:41:28,970 --> 02:41:30,040
失去了目标
I have no path.

2279
02:41:30,040 --> 02:41:31,320
但我有便车可以搭
I do have a ride though.

2280
02:41:31,620 --> 02:41:33,490
动作快点  大毛球
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2281
02:41:37,930 --> 02:41:39,080
你们在这里啊
Oh, here we are!

2282
02:41:40,030 --> 02:41:41,630
树  见到你真高兴
Tree, good to see you.

2283
02:41:46,270 --> 02:41:48,880
阿斯加德银河护卫队又重聚了
The Asgardians of the Galaxy back together again.

2284
02:41:49,880 --> 02:41:51,060
我们先去哪儿
Where to first?

2285
02:41:54,690 --> 02:41:56,900
提醒你一下  这还是我的飞船
Just so you know, this is my ship still.

2286
02:41:56,900 --> 02:41:57,880
我说了算
I'm in charge.

2287
02:41:58,110 --> 02:42:00,520
我知道  当然是你说了算
I know. I know. Of course you are.

2288
02:42:01,020 --> 02:42:01,990
当然了
Of course.

2289
02:42:05,170 --> 02:42:07,420
你说"当然了"  但你又碰地图了
See, you say, "of course," but then you touch the map.

2290
02:42:07,820 --> 02:42:08,540
这会让人觉得
It makes you think that

2291
02:42:08,540 --> 02:42:10,610
也许你并不明白是我说了算
maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.

2292
02:42:10,810 --> 02:42:13,620
-葵尔  这只是你的不安全感  -葵尔
- Quail, that's your own insecurities in there. - Quail?

2293
02:42:13,620 --> 02:42:16,110
我只是想帮忙和协助
Okay? I am merely trying to be of service and assisting.

2294
02:42:16,110 --> 02:42:17,060
是奎尔
Quill.

2295
02:42:17,540 --> 02:42:18,550
我就是这么说的
That's what I said.

2296
02:42:18,560 --> 02:42:20,990
你们应该为领袖地位的荣耀一战较高下
You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.

2297
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:22,120
这样公平
Sounds fair.

2298
02:42:25,090 --> 02:42:27,450
-没必要吧  -没必要
- It's not necessary, okay? - It's not.

2299
02:42:27,450 --> 02:42:28,490
我有爆能枪
I got some blasters,

2300
02:42:28,490 --> 02:42:30,150
除非你们想用刀
unless you guys wanna use knives.

2301
02:42:30,480 --> 02:42:32,600
好啊  请用刀吧
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2302
02:42:32,600 --> 02:42:33,660
用刀吧
Yeah. Knives.

2303
02:42:33,670 --> 02:42:34,850
我是格鲁特
I am Groot.

2304
02:42:41,220 --> 02:42:42,630
没必要的
Not necessary.

2305
02:42:42,630 --> 02:42:44,270
我们不该以刀相见
There shall be no knifing one another.

2306
02:42:44,280 --> 02:42:46,740
大家都知道谁说了算
Everybody knows who's in charge.

2307
02:42:50,890 --> 02:42:51,860
我
Me.

2308
02:42:53,540 --> 02:42:54,460
对吧
Right?

2309
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:56,840
没错  是你
Yes, you.

2310
02:42:57,480 --> 02:42:58,470

2311
02:42:58,860 --> 02:42:59,810
当然

2312
02:43:00,170 --> 02:43:01,150
当然
Of course.

2313
02:43:03,410 --> 02:43:04,390
记住
Remember...

2314
02:43:05,800 --> 02:43:08,280
你得把宝石还回它们被拿走的那一刻
you have to return the stones to the exact moment you got 'em

2315
02:43:08,280 --> 02:43:11,080
否则就会开启一堆讨厌的平行现实
or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.

2316
02:43:11,710 --> 02:43:12,810
别担心  布鲁斯
Don't worry, Bruce.

2317
02:43:13,180 --> 02:43:14,400
阻断所有时间分支
Clip all the branches.

2318
02:43:15,650 --> 02:43:16,820
我试过的
You know, I tried.

2319
02:43:18,660 --> 02:43:20,490
我戴着铁臂和宝石时
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,

2320
02:43:20,490 --> 02:43:22,160
我努力想把她带回来了
I really tried to bring her back.

2321
02:43:26,220 --> 02:43:27,370
我很想她
I miss her, man.

2322
02:43:28,370 --> 02:43:29,310
我也是
Me too.

2323
02:43:33,180 --> 02:43:35,510
如果你想  我可以跟你一起去
You know, if you want, I could come with you.

2324
02:43:38,280 --> 02:43:39,400
你是个好人  山姆
You're a good man, Sam.

2325
02:43:40,160 --> 02:43:41,400
但这次我要一个人去
This one's on me, though.

2326
02:43:46,240 --> 02:43:48,050
别干傻事  等我回来
Don't do anything stupid till I get back.

2327
02:43:49,990 --> 02:43:51,010
我怎么会
How can I?

2328
02:43:51,380 --> 02:43:53,070
你把傻气都带走了
You're taking all the stupid with you.

2329
02:44:00,940 --> 02:44:02,080
我会想你的  兄弟
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2330
02:44:02,900 --> 02:44:04,080
我不会有事的  巴基
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2331
02:44:11,840 --> 02:44:13,310
他要去多久
How long is this gonna take?

2332
02:44:13,950 --> 02:44:16,570
他需要多久都行  对我们来说只有五秒钟
For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds.

2333
02:44:21,940 --> 02:44:23,020
准备好了吗  队长
You ready, Cap?

2334
02:44:23,340 --> 02:44:25,240
那我们在这儿等你回来了
All right, we'll meet you back here, okay?

2335
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:27,240
没问题
You bet.

2336
02:44:28,420 --> 02:44:29,650

Going quantum.

2337

一

2340
02:44:35,250 --> 02:44:37,290
回归倒计时  五

一

2345
02:44:49,610 --> 02:44:50,560
他人呢
Where is he?

2346
02:44:50,710 --> 02:44:52,570
不知道  他错过了他的时间戳
I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp.

2347
02:44:52,570 --> 02:44:53,700
他应该回来了
He should be here.

2348
02:44:59,730 --> 02:45:00,610
把他带回来
Get him back.

2349
02:45:00,620 --> 02:45:01,950
-我在弄呢  -赶紧把他带回来
- I'm trying. - Get him the hell back.

2350
02:45:01,950 --> 02:45:04,160

队长
Cap?

2353
02:45:50,520 --> 02:45:51,450
山姆
Hi, Sam.

2354
02:45:55,310 --> 02:45:58,120
是出了差错  还是一切如愿
So, did something go wrong or did something go right?

2355
02:46:00,470 --> 02:46:03,680
我把宝石放回去后  我想着
Well, after I put the stones back, I thought...

2356
02:46:05,430 --> 02:46:06,370
要不
maybe...

2357
02:46:07,150 --> 02:46:11,300
我去试试托尼叫我去过的那种生活吧
I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.

2358
02:46:14,140 --> 02:46:15,690
结果如何
How'd that work out for ya?

2359
02:46:18,660 --> 02:46:19,770
妙不可言
It was beautiful.

2360
02:46:21,490 --> 02:46:22,680
那就好  我替你高兴

谢谢
Thank you.

2363
02:46:27,700 --> 02:46:29,000
只有一件事让我不爽
Only thing bumming me out

2364
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:30,550
就是我不得不生活在一个
is the fact I have to live in a world

2365
02:46:30,550 --> 02:46:32,160
没有美国队长的世界里
without Captain America.

2366
02:46:36,620 --> 02:46:37,820
这倒提醒了我
That reminds me.

2367
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:48,890
试试吧
Try it on.

2368
02:47:14,610 --> 02:47:15,650
感觉如何
How does it feel?

2369
02:47:18,660 --> 02:47:19,980
感觉是别人的
Like it's someone else's.

2370
02:47:23,430 --> 02:47:24,470
不是了
It isn't.

2371
02:47:37,910 --> 02:47:38,820
谢谢
Thank you.

2372
02:47:41,220 --> 02:47:42,340
我会全力以赴的
I'll do my best.

2373
02:47:47,960 --> 02:47:49,230
所以它是你的了
That's why it's yours.

2374
02:47:51,640 --> 02:47:53,040
要不要和我说说她
You wanna tell me about her?

2375
02:47:59,490 --> 02:48:00,420
不
No.

2376
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:02,860
不  还是算了
No, I don't think I will.
